# Reset MySQL Root Password

## skip-grant-tables

The first step to resetting a lost MySQL root password, is to restart your MySQL server with this variable set:
 - skip-grant-tables

You can do this, by editing the MySQL configuration file usually found here:
```console
/etc/my.cnf
```

As per the below, add "skip-grant-tables" to your MySQL config:
```console
[mysqld]
skip-grant-tables
```

Now that this has been set, you can restart MySQL:
```console
[root@dev-01 ~]# systemctl restart mysql
[root@dev-01 ~]#

[root@dev-01 ~]# mysql
Welcome to the MariaDB monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.

```

## Updating The Password

Now that MySQL is running with "skip-grant-tables", you can update the password with this command:
```console
UPDATE mysql.user SET Password=PASSWORD('password_here') WHERE User='root';
```

```console
MariaDB [(none)]> UPDATE mysql.user SET Password=PASSWORD('NEW-PASSWORD') WHERE User='root';
Query OK, 4 rows affected (0.002 sec)
Rows matched: 4  Changed: 4  Warnings: 0
```

Now run "FLUSH PRIVILEGES;":
```
MariaDB [(none)]> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.003 sec)
```

You can now remove the flag from "/etc/my.cnf", and restart MySQL:
```
[root@dev-01 ~]# systemctl restart mysql
[root@dev-01 ~]#
```
