# Reset MySQL Root Password

## Skip the grants table

The first step to resetting a lost MySQL root password, is to restart your MySQL server with this variable set:

 - `skip-grant-tables`

You can do this, by editing the MySQL configuration file usually found here:

```console
vim /etc/my.cnf
```

As per the below, add `skip-grant-tables` to your MySQL config:

```ini
[mysqld]
skip-grant-tables
```

Now that this has been set, you can restart MySQL:

```console
systemctl restart mysql
```

And try connecting

```bash
mysql
```

```none

```

## Updating The Password

Now that MySQL is running with `skip-grant-tables`, you can update the password with this command:

```sql
UPDATE mysql.user SET Password=PASSWORD('password_here') WHERE User='root';
```

```console
MariaDB [(none)]> UPDATE mysql.user SET Password=PASSWORD('password_here') WHERE User='root';
Query OK, 4 rows affected (0.002 sec)
Rows matched: 4  Changed: 4  Warnings: 0
```

Now run `FLUSH PRIVILEGES;` to write the changes to disk:

```none
MariaDB [(none)]> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.003 sec)
```

You can now remove the `skip-grant-tables` flag from `/etc/my.cnf`, and restart MySQL:

```bash
systemctl restart mysql
```
