# MySQL Command Line Basics

In this tutorial, we will cover the basics of MySQL command line. MySQL CLI is a client for accessing the MySQL server daemon and will allow you to access, retrieve and modify your databases and users through your Linux server.

It is available through the base CentOS and Ubuntu repositories. The commands below will help you browse through your databases and look at your users.


## Access MySQL through your shell

Once you have logged into your server through SSH using a client like PuTTY, use the command below to access the MySQL CLI. This will require you to know the credentials for the user you are using.

```bash
  mysql -u root -p
```


Once logged in your should see something like the following prompt.

```console
  Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
  Your MySQL connection id is 479
  Server version: 5.1.73-14.12 Percona Server (GPL), Release 14.12, Revision 624

  Type 'help;' or '\h' for help. Type '\c' to clear the current input statement.

  mysql>
```


## View Database and Tables

You should now be able to view your databases and tables. This can be done use the commands below.

```sql
  SHOW DATABASES;
```

You can also use a database from the list of databases available to you.


```sql
  USE database_wp;
```

This will show the following information.

```console
  Reading table information for completion of table and column names
  You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A

  Database changed
  mysql>
```

Here you can view your tables and even run queries.

```sql
  SHOW TABLES;
```

Here is an example query from a Magento database, where we are checking the current base URL:

```sql
  SELECT * FROM core_config_data WHERE path LIKE '%base%url%';
```



### Users and GRANTS

You can also view your users. All of the users that are available on your MySQL install will be shown using the command below.

```sql
  SELECT user, host FROM mysql.user;
```

MySQL users have 2 parts: username and host, usually written as 'username'@'host'. Username is self-explanatory. Host defines where that user is allowed to connect from. For example, 'dbuser'@'123.123.123.123', which will allow dbuser to connect from the IP address 123.123.123.123, or 'root'@'localhost' means the root user, connecting from the local server only.

Note that this means you could have 2 users with the same username, as long as they have different hosts. So 'dbuser'@'123.123.123.123' and 'dbuser'@'111.111.111.111' can both exist on the same server.

A thing to note here is that the `root@localhost` user is NOT the same as `root@127.0.0.1`! MySQL (and linux in general) treats sockets differently to TCP/IP connections unless there is an alias associated with it. You can read more about this by using the link to the [official MySQL documentation](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.5/en/can-not-connect-to-server.html).

You can also view grants for an individual user using the command below.

```console
  mysql> SHOW GRANTS for root@localhost;
  +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | Grants for root@localhost                                           |
  +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
  | GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION |
  +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
  1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```
