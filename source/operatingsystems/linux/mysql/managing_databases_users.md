# Managing Databases and Users

This guide outlines some common tasks when it comes to managing your MySQL database and users.


## Reset a normal user's password

Run the following query to change a user's password:
 ```sql
  UPDATE mysql.user SET Password = PASSWORD("ChooseAStrongPassword") WHERE User="username" ;
  exit
 ```

## Reset the root user password

Losing your MySQL root password can be a problem. Luckily there is a fairly quick solution to reset the root password with minimal downtime.

Stop MySQL, and start it with the '--skip-grant-tables' option so you can login without the password. Log into MySQL as root:

```console
  service mysql stop
  mysqld --skip-grant-tables
  mysql -u root
```

Run the following query to change the root user password, then exit:
 ```sql  
  UPDATE mysql.user SET Password = PASSWORD("ChooseAStrongPassword") WHERE User="root" ;
  exit
 ```

Stop and restart MySQL:
 ```console
  service mysql stop
  service mysql start
```

Test logging in with the new password:
 ```console
  mysql -u root -p
```

## To change GRANTS, create new users or modify existing users

Use the commands below.

```sql
  CREATE DATABASE dbname;
  CREATE USER dbuser@00.00.00.00;
  SET PASSWORD FOR dbuser@00.00.00.00= PASSWORD("password");
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON dbname.* TO dbuser@00.00.00.00 IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
