# VSFTPd

## What is vsftpd?

VSFTPd stands for Very Secure File Transfer Protocol.

It is a Linux FTP appication that is used to transfer files between computers using an FTP client such as FileZilla, and by default, the port used is port 21.

## Adding users for FTP usage

In order to create an account that can use vsftpd, you will first need to set up a user on the server that you want to transfer files to and from.

The first step is to add a user. This can be done using the "useradd" command, as shown below:

```bash
  useradd guest
```

Once you have added a user, you will want to make that account secure by adding a password. Using the "passwd" command and then specifying a user, you will then be prompted to add/change the password for the given user:

```bash
  passwd guest
```

## Add attributes to the user

Now that you have added a user, you will want to change the attributes of that user so they have the correct permissions to use vsftpd. Using the "usermod" command, the below command changes the shell for the user so that they cannot log into the server via SSH:

```bash
  usermod -s /sbin/nologin guest
```

Note, this can also be achieved by editing the `/etc/passwd` file.

## vsftpd configuration

With your FTP user configured, you will want to ensure that the configuration file for VSFTPd is correct.

The configuration file for vsftpd can be found at `/etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf`. You will want to edit this file to contain the configuration displayed below:

```console
pam_service_name=vsftpd
userlist_enable=YES
tcp_wrappers=YES
anonymous_enable=NO
chroot_local_user=YES
rsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem
rsa_private_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/vsftpd.pem
ssl_enable=YES
allow_anon_ssl=NO
force_local_data_ssl=YES
force_local_logins_ssl=YES
ssl_tlsv1=YES
ssl_sslv2=NO
ssl_sslv3=NO
require_ssl_reuse=NO
ssl_ciphers=HIGH
pasv_enable=YES
pasv_min_port=8443
pasv_max_port=8443
allow_writeable_chroot=YES
```

Note, this configuration was tested on CentOS 7.
