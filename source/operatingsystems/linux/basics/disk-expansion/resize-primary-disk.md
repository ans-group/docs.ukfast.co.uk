# Resize the primary disk *(advanced)*

If you need to resize the primary disk for some reason, you will need to create a new partition to utilise any additional space you assign to it. This is because the disk will have already been partitoned as follows:

```bash
[root@ssh ~]# fdisk -l /dev/sda

Disk /dev/sda: 21.5 GB, 21474836480 bytes, 41943040 sectors
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disk label type: dos
Disk identifier: 0x00001caf

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sda1   *        2048     1026047      512000   83  Linux
/dev/sda2         1026048    20971519     9972736   8e  Linux LVM

[root@ssh ~]#
```

Where `sda1` is `/boot`, and `sda2` is the first physical volume in the eCloud Volume Group (VG).

```eval_rst
.. warning::
   **This article is for advanced Linux administrators.** If you're not comfortable with Linux and want to increase the amount of disk space assigned to your server, the `add a new disk <add-disk.html>`_ method is recommended.
```

## Rescan the SCSI hosts

Firstly we need to rescan the SCSI hosts to detect changes in disk size.

```bash
[root@ssh ~]# for i in /sys/class/scsi_host/host*/scan; do echo "- - -" > $i; done
[root@ssh ~]# for i in /sys/class/scsi_device/*/device/rescan; do echo "1" > $i; done
```

## Extend an existing partition

For disks that have been extended using the eCloud control panel, you will use the `growpart` command to extend the last partition.

In the below example we can see that the last device partition number is `/dev/sda4`

```bash
[root@ssh ~]# fdisk -l

Disk /dev/sda: 118.1 GB, 118111600640 bytes, 230686720 sectors
Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
Disk label type: dos
Disk identifier: 0x0009cb29

   Device Boot      Start         End      Blocks   Id  System
/dev/sda1   *        2048      526335      262144   83  Linux
/dev/sda2          526336    41943006    20708335+  8e  Linux LVM
/dev/sda3        41943040   125829119    41943040   83  Linux
/dev/sda4       125829120   230686686    52428783+  83  Linux
```

Now that we have the partition number that we are going to extend, we will use the following command to grow the size of the last partition

```bash
[root@ssh ~]# growpart /dev/sda 4
CHANGED: partition=4 start=125829120 old: size=58720256 end=184549376 new: size=104857567,end=230686687
```

The output of `fdisk -l` will show the additional space is now present for /dev/sda4

Finish off by resizing the physical volume into the newly extended disk

```bash
root@ssh ~]# pvresize /dev/sda4
  Physical volume "/dev/sda4" changed
  1 physical volume(s) resized or updated / 0 physical volume(s) not resized
```

## Create a new partition

Alternatively, there is the option to create a new partition on `sda` to use the newly assigned disk space.

```eval_rst
.. note::
   The below uses a specific example of disk sizes and partition number. Please take care to ensure that your answers to these questions are accurate.
```

Here is an example of creating a new partition:

```bash
[root@ssh ~]# fdisk /dev/sda
Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.23.2).

Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
Be careful before using the write command.

The kernel still uses the old table. The new table will be used at
the next reboot or after you run partprobe(8) or kpartx(8)
Syncing disks.

[root@ssh ~]#
```

If you want the above partition to form part of a Linux LVM, it would be recommended to use the `t` option to change the partition type to `8e`.

Following this, you can use the instructions in [add an additional disk](add-disk) to add this disk into an existing LVM, or make whatever more advanced changes you require with this additional partition.

**You may need to reboot your server for the new partition to be available.**
