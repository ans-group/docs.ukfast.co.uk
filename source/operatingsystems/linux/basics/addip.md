# Adding an IP Address

```eval_rst
.. note::

   You should speak with your account manager to have an IP address assigned to
   you before adding IPs to your server.
```

The quickest way to add an IP on either CentOS or Ubuntu would be to use the `ip` command as follows:

```bash
   ip addr add 10.10.10.10/28 brd + dev eth0
```

That example would add an IP of 10.10.10.10 with a netmask of 255.255.255.240 (/28) onto the interface eth0.

Although there's nothing wrong with that command, the IP won't persist beyond a reboot.

For that, we'll need to add it the respective network configuration file for our operating system.

## CentOS


On CentOS 5, 6 and 7, IP addresses are added in files in the following directory:

```console
   /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts
```

Files should be created with the name 'ifcfg-ethX' and have the following content:

```console
   DEVICE=eth0:1
   ONBOOT=yes
   BOOTPROTO=static
   IPADDR=192.168.0.1
   NETMASK=255.255.255.0
```

Once you've added the your configuration file, bring the interface up with the ifup command:

```bash
   ifup eth0:1
```

## Ubuntu

On Ubuntu, all the network config is typically stored in one file:
`/etc/network/interfaces`

This file should already exist as it'll have your existing network configuration in place.

Additional IP addresses should be added underneath the existing configuration with the following syntax:

```console
   auto eth0:1
   iface eth0:1 inet static
      address 192.168.0.1
      netmask 255.255.255.0
```

Again, the interface can be brough up with ifup, as so:

```bash
   ifup eth0:1
```
