# Magento Time To First Byte (TTFB)

Time to first btye (TTFB) is a measurement to show the responsiveness of your Magento website. TTFB measures the duration from the end user making an HTTP request to the first byte of the page being received by the end user's browser. Magento can show a slower TTFB as it does not send any bytes until PHP has rendered the whole page (Unless there are cache mechanism in place).
