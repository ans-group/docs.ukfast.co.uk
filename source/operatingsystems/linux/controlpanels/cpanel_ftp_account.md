# Creating An FTP Account In cPanel

You might need to create FTP accounts in cPanel, so that you and/or your developers can upload and download content from your website.  

In order to do this, start by logging into the cPanel account that you want to create the FTP account for. [You can find our guide on this here!](cpanel_connect.md)  

Now, navigate to:
```
Files >> FTP Accounts
```

You will be looking at this page:

![ImageToShowFTPAccountPage](LinkGoesHere)

From here, fill in a username and password for the account, and give it a quota if you need (This can be left as unlimited by default).  

The last box says "Directory", unless the account needs to only access a specific folder, this can be left default also.  

Now you can click "Create".
