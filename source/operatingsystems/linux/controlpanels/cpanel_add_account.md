# Adding an Account in WHM

Once you've got your WHM server setup, you're going to want to add an **account**. In WHM, an **account** can be thought of as a catch-all term for a domain and associated resources. When you add an **account**, this creates;

* A `Virtual Host` for your domain.
* A `User`, for ftp/sftp/ssh administration
* A `Control Panel` for your domain, allowing for per user site administration (*email, subdomains, PHP settings etc.*)

On the homepage of WHM, you will see a section called "Manage Your Accounts", and a "Create a New Account" button below that:

This will present you with a page to fill in information regarding the account that you're adding. The top section is "Domain Information". Fill in the relevant information for the account you're adding:

```eval_rst
.. warning::
  Avoid adding a domain that is the same as the hostname of the server, as this will break many WHM services.
  
```

The next three sections can be left as the defaults:

For the "DNS Settings" section, untick the box labelled "Enable DKIM on this account":

For the final section, "Mail Routing Settings", choose the automatic configuration option, then you can click "Create":
