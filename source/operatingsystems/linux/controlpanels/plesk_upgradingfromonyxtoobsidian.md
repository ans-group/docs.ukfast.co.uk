# Upgrading from Plesk Onyx to Plesk Obsidian

```eval_rst
.. note::
   Web and Databases services running on your Plesk server will be restarted multiple times throughout the Plesk upgrade process causing intermittent downtime on any live sites.
   The Plesk UI will also be inaccessible through the process and therefore we recommend you execute your Plesk upgrade at your most convenient time.
```

Plesk Obsidian has lots of new and improved features over Plesk Onyx and Obsidian is now available to Plesk users.
The following guide is on upgrading your Plesk Onyx installation in place to Plesk Obsidian via the Plesk Web Interface.

Once you are on the Plesk Homepage, go to "Tools & Settings" and then click on "Updates and Upgrades" under the "Plesk" section.
Clicking on that link will open a new window which will take you to your server on port 8447 which is the port the Plesk Installer runs on.

.. note::
   Unable to access your server on port 8447? Ensure that your firewall is allowing your connection through on that port number.
