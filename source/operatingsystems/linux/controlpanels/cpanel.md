# Overview

cPanel/WHM gives you a powerful web based GUI to manage many aspects of your server, taking a lot of the work out of managing a server with multiple sites.

If a server is said to have cPanel installed on it, there are two distinct interfaces:

* WHM
* cPanel

WHM, or Web Host Manager, is the top level control panel that allows you to create user accounts (domains) and manage server level options.

cPanel is for management of individual sites and controls things such as mailboxes and site specific variables.

## Our Guides
