# Performing a cPanel to cPanel Migration

A guide on performing a cPanel to cPanel Migration

```eval_rst
.. note::
   cPanel requires the ability to connect to your other cPanel server via your defined SSH port and port 2087
```

To begin your migration you first need to ensure you are logged into your WHM panel.
The migration can only be started via WHM, which is the server-wide control panel, as opposed to cPanel which is the domain specific panel for your sites.

```eval_rst
.. note::
   cPanel Migrations have to be initiated from the destination cPanel server
```

Once you are logged in to WHM, use the search box in the top left under the WHM logo to search for "Transfer Tool"
Click on "Transfer Tool" to be directed to the Transfer Tool page in which you can start your migration.

- Remote Server Address: The IP Address of the other server
- Remote SSH Port: The port SSH is bound to on the other server
- Root Password: The password for the root user on the other server

```eval_rst
.. note::
   UKFast Linux Servers listen on port 2020 for SSH by default
```

Next, click the "Scan Remote Server" button which will have the migration tool connect to the remote server and scan for migratable accounts

Before amending your DNS to point to your new server, you can test your websites using a hostfile change
