# PCI compliance and Plesk

Starting with Plesk 12.5, Plesk created a one line command to apply a set of defaults which comply to common PCI standards. While it's not a 100% catch-all solution, it's a great starting point if you need to prepare for PCI compliance scans.

The command to run is as follows:

``#
plesk sbin pci_compliance_resolver {--enable|--disable}
``

Alternatively, if you have more specific requirements and don't wish to apply Plesk's defaults to your entire server you can build your own using the "plesk sbin sslmng" command. A common use of this would be to address the [Logjam vulnerability](/security/logjam).

``#
plesk sbin sslmng --strong-dh
``
