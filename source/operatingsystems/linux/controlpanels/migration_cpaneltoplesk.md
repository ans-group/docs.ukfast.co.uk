.. note::
   Plesk requires the ability to connect to your cPanel server via your defined SSH port to complete any migrations.
```

To begin your migration you first need to ensure you are logged into your Plesk Web Interface.
Once you are logged in, click on the "Tools and Settings" link on the left hand side menu.

When Plesk has scanned the remote server for migratable cPanel Accounts, select what you want to copy over.
Ensure that your chosen cPanel Accounts are in the "Selected" box in the "Subscriptions".
Make sure you have ticked what content you want to transfer under the "Content that must be transferred" section.
Once you are ready to start the migration, click the "Migrate" button.
