# NFS

### Install NFS
You can install NFS with the following command:
```bash
~]# yum install nfs-utils nfs-utils-lib 
```

### Distributed Files/Folders
It's very important to only use NFS for files/folder which need to be distributed between multiple servers. We strongly advise against having the entire document root of your website on NFS.

#### Direct Mount Point
You can directly mount NFS to the folder within your document root:

```bash
NFSSERVER/nfsshare/media -> /var/www/vhosts/domain.com/htdocs/media
```
You can do this with the following entry in /etc/fstab:

```bash
 ~]# cat /etc/fstab | grep -i nfs
NFSSERVER:/nfsshare/media /var/www/vhosts/domain.com/htdocs/media nfs rw,noatime,nodiratime,async,timeo=1800 0 0
 ~]# mount /var/www/vhosts/domain.com/htdocs/media
```

#### Symlinks
You can symlink files/folders from your document root to the NFS mount point.

```bash
~]# ln -s /var/www/vhosts/domain.com/htdocs/media /nfsshare/media
```

### Open File Check
You can see all the NFS open files with the following command:
```bash
~]# lsof -N
```

### Write Speed Test
Using the dd command you can write a file to the local file system and then to the NFS mount point to then compare the speed results. The write speeds over NFS should always be slower

#### Local File System
```bash
~]# dd if=/dev/zero of=/root/testfile bs=1G count=1 oflag=direct
1073741824 bytes (1.1 GB) copied, 1.12829 s, 952 MB/s
~]# rm -f /root/testfile
```

#### NFS Mount Point
This write speed test creates the file /nfsshare/testfile with NFS being mounted to /nfsshare/

```bash
~]# dd if=/dev/zero of=/nfsshare/testfile bs=1G count=1 oflag=direct
1073741824 bytes (1.1 GB) copied, 1.82611 s, 588 MB/s
~]# rm -f /nfsshare/testfile
```
