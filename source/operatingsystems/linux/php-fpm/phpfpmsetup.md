# Installing and Configuring PHP-FPM

`PHP-FPM` is a service which executes *PHP* code on behalf of a web server. As `Nginx` is unable to natively execute *PHP* code, it can be onfigured to pass all *.php* files over to `PHP-FPM.`

`Apache` is able to execute PHP itself with *mod_php*, but from version `2.4+` you can now also pass *.php* files to `PHP-FPM`.

## Installation

To install `PHP-FPM` use the following command.

```console
  yum install php-fpm
```

This will create the file `/etc/php-fpm.d/www.conf`

Using the `enable --now` flag, we can *start* the service and set it to *start on boot* all at once.

```console
  systemctl enable --now php-fpm
```

## Configuration

### Remote Server 

By default, this configuration starts a `PHP-FPM` server listening on *port 9000* that binds to `127.0.0.1` (localhost).

If your intention is to run `PHP-FPM`on a *separate server*, then you will need to amend the following values in your `PHP-FPM` domain configuration file.

```bash
listen = <add your internal ip address>:9000
listen.allowed_clients = 127.0.0.1,<add your remote server ip address>
```
 You can then pass all your PHP requests over to this port on your dedicated `PHP-FPM` server.

```eval_rst
.. warning::

   Always be aware of the risks of opening additional firewall ports, and restrict to specific IP addresses where possible.

```

### Local Server
If you're running `PHP-FPM` on the *same* server as your web server, it's a much better idea to configure a `unix socket` to pass requests to, instead of a `port`. This means the communication is handled by the **kernel**, instead being tied to any network **TCP** limits.

```
listen = '/var/run/php-fcgi-firstdomaincom.sock'
```
#### Example

```eval_rst
.. note::

   Creating a PHP-FPM pool per site allows for greater separation of resource, and makes it simpler to identify problematic sites using up excessive resource

 ```

 Here is a sample configuration for a domain called domain.com.

```console
[firstdomaincom]

listen = '/var/run/php-fcgi-firstdomaincom.sock'
;listen.backlog = -1
listen.allowed_clients = 127.0.0.1
listen.owner = apache
listen.group = apache
;listen.mode = 0666

user = firstdomainuser
group = firstdomainuser

pm = dynamic
pm.max_children = 300
pm.start_servers = 5
pm.min_spare_servers = 5
pm.max_spare_servers = 20
pm.max_requests = 2000
;pm.status_path = /status

;ping.path = /ping
;ping.response = pong

;request_terminate_timeout = 0
;request_slowlog_timeout = 0
slowlog = /var/www/vhosts/firstdomain.com/phpfpm-slow.log

;rlimit_files = 1024
;rlimit_core = 0

;chroot =

;chdir = /var/www

;catch_workers_output = yes

;env[HOSTNAME] = $HOSTNAME
;env[PATH] = /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
;env[TMP] = /tmp
;env[TMPDIR] = /tmp
;env[TEMP] = /tmp

php_admin_value[error_log] =  /var/www/vhosts/firstdomain.com/phpfpm-error.log
php_admin_flag[log_errors] = on
```

This is configured to work with `Apache`. If you were configuring this with `Nginx`, you would replace these lines.

```console
listen.owner = nginx
listen.group = nginx
```

The `PHP-FPM` pool itself needs to run as its *own* Linux user.

```console
user = firstdomainuser
group = firstdomainuser
```

You will then need to run a **configuration test**.

```console
 php-fpm -t
```

and then *reload* the configuration.

```console
  systemctl reload php-fpm
```

You should now be able to see the `PHP-FPM` socket.

```console
  stat /var/run/php-fcgi-firstdomaincom.sock
```

 which should show something like.

 ```console
   File: â€˜/var/run/php-fcgi-firstdomaincom.sock'

```eval_rst
.. note::

   The pm values in the configuration are there mainly to prevent the server from running out of memory. However, on servers with higher specification these values can be increased.
