# `PHP-FPM`

### Error Log

The error log for the `PHP-FPM` service is:

```bash
/var/log/php-fpm/error.log
```

### Config File

The main configuration file for `PHP-FPM` is:

```bash
`/etc/php-fpm.conf`
```

This file has an include to `/etc/php-fpm.d/*.conf`:

```ini
~]# grep include /etc/php-fpm.conf
include=/etc/php-fpm.d/*.conf
```

### Domain Error Log

The error log for your domain is located just outside of the document root:

```bash
/var/www/vhosts/domain.com/domain.com-phpfpm-error.log
```

This error log should be reviewed regularly as you may see `PHP` errors in this file.

### Domain Config File

The `PHP-FPM` configuration pool for your domain is located in `/etc/php-fpm.d/`

```bash
/etc/php-fpm.d/domaincom.conf
```
### Enable Core Dumps

PHP-FPM may log a `SIGSEGV` error in the service's error log file, example:

```bash
WARNING: [pool poolname] child 20196 exited on signal 11 (SIGSEGV) after 6.772815 seconds from start
```

Enabling core dumps can help to debug and find the cause of the `SIGSEGV`.

If you need to enable core dumps you can run the below commands:
```bash
echo '/tmp/core-%e.%p' > /proc/sys/kernel/core_pattern
echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/core_uses_pid
ulimit -c unlimited
sysctl fs.suid_dumpable=2
```

Then set the `rlimit_core` directive in the PHP-FPM configuration pool  (`/etc/php-fpm.d/domain.conf`) to unlimited:
```bash
rlimit_core = unlimited
```

Restart PHP-FPM and check the error log file for the `SIGSEGV`, you should now see `Ccore dumped`:

```bash
WARNING: [pool poolname] child 20196 exited on signal 11 (SIGSEGV - core dumped) after 6.772815 seconds from start
```

Core dumps should now be generated by PHP-FPM in the directory `/tmp/`. You may need to install `gdb` `(yum install gdb)` so you can read the core dump file with the command `gdb $program-path $coredump-path`. Example:

```bash
gdb /usr/sbin/php-fpm /tmp/coredump-php-fpm.1594
```

Once in the `gdb` prompt the `bt` command will show you the PHP `backtrace` on the moment of the core dump. To exit `gdb`, just type quit.
