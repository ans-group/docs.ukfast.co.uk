If you are having email issues, such as mail ending up in spam, a good way to see what is going on is to run a mail-tester.

Simply navigate to:

https://www.mail-tester.com/

And send an email to the address shown.

When you have recieved the results, they will give your mail a score which is based on a number of factors.

If you are unable to fix your issue based on this, you can create a support ticket for a support engineer to have a look at the issue for you. 

When creating a support ticket, it is best to send the engineers the link to the results of the mail-tester and some credentials that they can use to recreate the issue for themselves.
