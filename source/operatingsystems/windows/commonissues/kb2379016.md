# KB2379016 - Windows Server 2008 stuck at "Applying user settings..."

This is a known issue in Windows Server 2008 that has subsequently been fixed in Windows Server 2008R2


The issue occurs because of a deadlock in the Service Control Manager database.

The Service Control Manager tries to start the `HTTP.sys` service and then puts a lock in place in the Service Control Manager database.
`HTTP.sys` then makes a call that requires Cryptographic Services during startup, this triggers a request to start Cryptographic Services. 
However, a lock is already in place in the Service Control Manager database. Therefore, a deadlock occurs and neither service can start correctly.

* A Hotfix is available to resolve this issue, which can be downloading by visiting the following link
