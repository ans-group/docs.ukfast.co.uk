# Connecting to a server via Remote Desktop

It is most likely that Remote Desktop Protocol, or RDP, will be the primary way in which you interact with your windows server. Using an RDP client of some sort, you'll be able to get access to the full GUI of the remote server, as if you were sat in front of it with a screen plugged in.

.. note::
   The ability to connect via RDP should already be enabled on your windows server, but if you're having any problems with a UKFast server, it's worth contacting support_ for assistance.

## Client software

### Windows Clients

Presuming you're using Windows, head to one of the following locations to access the `Remote Desktop Connection` utility, which is the defacto standard RDP client.

On Windows 10:
