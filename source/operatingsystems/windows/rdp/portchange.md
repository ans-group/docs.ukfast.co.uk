# How to change the Remote Desktop Port



The remote desktop port may be changed for security reasons. You may notice the event with ID 4625 in the security logs, 
which is a failed login for a generic username, such as administrator. If you notice a large volume of these entries in the security log, this may be indicative of a brute force attack to the remote desktop service on your server.
One of the ways to mitigate this, is to change the listening port from the default port of 3389

* An important part of this process is to ensure that the new port is first opened on the firewall, 
  if it is not open, you will not be able to connect via RDP once the change has been made.

In order to change the RDP Port, you will first need to access the registry editor, please select start, and type regedit, select the regedit application from the list as below
