* The telnet command will now be active and usable via any command prompt window, or powershell window.

Open a command prompt or a powershell window by selecting start and selecting your chosen console, once the console has opened, type telnet "target ip" "target port" for example `telnet 10.20.10.20 25`and press enter on your keyboard.

If the connection is established, you will receive a response from the remote server as demonstrated below

If however, you are presented with a blank window, this could mean that the connection could not be established correctly, at this point, it is advised to review firewall rules etc to ensure that appropriate access is allowed to and from your target ip.
