# How to Create a User in Active Directory

* If your solution makes use of an Active Directory Domain Services (Domain Controller) server, then you will need to create a Domain User account for each user that you wish to have access to servers on the Domain, (local user accounts created on individual servers, will not be suitable as they will only allow access to the machine which they were created on)
