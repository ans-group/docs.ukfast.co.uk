Once you have run through these steps you will be automatically signed in.

## Standard login

Once you have run through the first time login process, you can login every time by entering your email address and password.

To log in, you need to navigate to your unique FASTdrive URL. This will be sent to you in a ticket along with your FASTdrive admin user credentials.

Below is an image of the standard log in screen that you will see. If you enter the correct credentials you will be successfully logged in.
