   The links above may take you to documentation for the latest OpenStack release of each project.  This may not be the same as the version we're running at UKFast.

To identify the current API version your eCloud Flex solution is based upon, login to your [eCloud Flex dashboard](https://api.openstack.ecloud.co.uk/project/api_access/) and head to API Access in the left hand menu.  You'll see a list of service endpoints which will help identify the correct version in use, and hence which documentation you should refer to.
