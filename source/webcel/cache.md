# Purging the Cache

Sometimes when you push an update to your website, you'll need to purge some of the items stored in the Webcelerator cache to force it to pull down a copy of the new file before the cached version has expired. To facilitate this, there are a few ways to purge a single object or a whole domain from the cache.

## Purging via MyUKFast

We provide an interface to purge your Webceletator cache via [MyUKFast](https://my.ukfast.co.uk), which can be found in *Products & Services* > *Webcelerator*:

![WebCel MyUKFast Purge](images/WebCel-MyUKFast-purge.png)

Simply enter a domain into the text box, or the URL to a specific file, and click "Purge Webcelerator Cache" to send a purge request to the Webcelerator.

Please note that this somtimes does not work if there are devices in front of the Webcelerator, which would require you to use another purging method below, such as the ones below.

## Purging via cURL

Slightly easier and more scriptable is the use of curl. The following command does the same as the above. (For clarity, that's a capital 'i' and a zero):

```
curl -I0 -X PURGE -H "Host: www.example.com" http://198.51.100.200/images/logo.png
```

This would return a `200 OK` response code if the purge was successful.

```
HTTP/1.1 200 Purged.
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Date: Wed, 17 Oct 2012 09:00:47 GMT
Age: 0
Connection: close
X-Cache: MISS
Server: WebCelerate
Via: WebCelerate
```

## Purging via telnet

You can submit purge requests via `telnet` if you so wish:

```
[user@server ~]# telnet 198.51.100.200 80
Trying 198.51.100.200...
Connected to 198.51.100.200.srvlist.ukfast.net (198.51.100.200)
Escape character is '^]'.
PURGE /images/logo.png HTTP/1.0
Host: www.example.com
```

Which should return a `200 OK` response code if the purge was successful.

## Purging via PHP

You could also submit purge requests from your application to do this programmatically as required. An example of performing a purge in PHP follows â€“ note that you will need the `pecl_http` module installing (on Linux boxes this can be done with the command `pecl install pecl_http`). Adjust `$DomainName`, `$VIP` and the `$request` as desired:

```php
<?php
  $DomainName = "www.example.com";
  $VIP = "198.51.100.200";
  HttpRequest::methodRegister('PURGE');
  $request = new HttpRequest("http://$VIP/images/logo.png",
  HttpRequest::METH_PURGE);
  $request->setHeaders(array('Host' => "$DomainName"));
  try {
    $request->send();
    var_dump($request->getResponseCode());
    if ($request->getResponseCode() == 200) {
      echo "Success!!";
    }
  } catch (HttpException $exception) {
    echo $exception;
  }
?>
```
