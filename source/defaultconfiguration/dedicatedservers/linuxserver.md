# Default Configuration for Linux Servers

## Pre-Launch Questionaire
With every dedicated server on your order form you will receive your Pre-Launch Questionnaire (PLQ). The PLQ give you the ability to verify the configuration for each server, firewall, or other configurable products on your order before we begin the launch process.

Once you are satisfied with your installation settings, please press the "Launch solution" button so that we can get your servers to you as quickly as possible. You will receive your PLQ within 15 minutes of your order form being processed.

To ensure that your order meets its scheduled launch date, the questionnaire will automatically close 24hrs after your order being processed and your server will meet the below default configuration. If you need more time to pre-configure your solution, you may extend the deadline by up to one week online, but please note that this may delay the delivery of your solution.

Please note that some of our more complex solutions may require you to complete additional documentation in order for us to gather as much information as possible to meet your requirements.

If you have a question about your order or our pre-launch process? You can call your Account Management Team on 0161 637 9321.
