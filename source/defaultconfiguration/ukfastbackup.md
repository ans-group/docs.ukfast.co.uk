# Default Configuration of UKFast Backups

In order for UKFast to simplify our backup schedule offering without losing the ability to tailor the configuration to your solution, we have predefined backup options available for you to select from. Please note that: 
- The default retention for Dedicated CommVault is 7 days.
- The backup run time is stipulated by UKFast in an overnight window, unless otherwise specified.

## Operating System and File Level Backups

- Physical and virtual machines have a full backup taken once a week by default.
- Physical and virtual machines have incremental backups taken every day (except for the day the full backup is taken).

### Backup Options

Option | Full Backup | Incremental Backup
------------ | ------------- | -------------
File Level - Option 1 (default)	| Weekly | Once Daily 
File Level - Option 2	| Daily	| n/a

## Database Backups

Database Level - Option 2	| Daily |	n/a
Database Level - Option 3 (default) |	Daily |	Every Hour
Database Level - Option 4 | Daily |	Every 15 minutes

## Standalone Database Servers

- Database servers (e.g. MSSQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL) are backed up at the database level.
- Database backup times are different to the operating system backup times to limit the impact on performance.

## File and Database Clusters

- Nodes in the clusters are backed up at different times to limit the impact on performance.
-	Database Clusters have an additional database level backup (again at different times to the nodes).
-	File Server Clusters will have an additional backup set up for the cluster drives. 

## Virtual Machine Level backups

### Backup Options

Option | Full Backup | Incremental Backup
------------ | ------------- | -------------
VM Level - Option 1 |	Weekly |	Once Daily 

All full backups for Virtual Machines are performed on a weekly basis with daily incremental backups taken daily except for the day the full backup is taken.

To make changes to the backup window, frequency or retention of any of your backup policies post launch, along with adding any backup exclusions to specific folders, files or file types please use the Priority Support System in the MyUKFast portal.
