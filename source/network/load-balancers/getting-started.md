# Getting Started

Once your new load balancer has been launched, it will appear in the [load balancers section](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/load-balancers) of your MyUKFast account. Any load balancers which haven't had their initial deployment will be marked with "Initial Setup Required".

Clicking on the load balancer will take you to the screens which you use to configure and deploy your new load balancer.

From the load balancer overview screen you can work your way through the onboarding wizard. If you already know how to setup a UKFast load balancer, you can skip this wizard and work your way through the screens yourself by clicking "Skip Onboarding Wizard".

You can also rename a load balancer to help you remember which load balancer is which if you have multiple in your account. This is done by clicking the pencil icon highlighted in blue on the screenshot below, typing in the new name and clicking the save icon.

A load balancer needs configuring with 3 aspects as a minimum:
- At least one target group
- At least one target within that target group
- At least one listener

There are also optional aspects which can be configure within a load balancer, for example:
- Access IP controls
- SSL certificates
- Access control rules

For more information on these terms, check out the [key terms page](key-terms.html).



Once you have finished configuring your load balancer, it is time to [deploy your changes](deploying-changes.html).
