# Common Changes

## Adding a new server behind the load balancer

## Replacing an expired SSL certificate

SSL certificates have expiry dates which once reached will start to show security errors to users visiting the website. You can easily replace your load balancers SSL certificates with a new one when they expire within MyUKFast.

Firstly open the affected load balancer within [MyUKFast](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/load-balancers), then click on `Listeners` at the top of the overview screen.

Click the listener which is affected by the expired SSL, followed by the `SSLs` tab.

Press the delete button on the expired SSL certificate and accept the confirmation box which pops up. You can now see there are changes ready to deploy, leave this button for now.

Click the `Create SSL` button in the top right of the screen and fill in the form with your new SSL certificate details. If the certificate has been bought within MyUKFast you can choose `Import UKFast Certificate`, select the certificate and have the details filled in automatically. Once the form is complete, press save.

Once you have created the new SSL certificate, you can click the `deployments screen` link at the top of the screen. Press `Deploy Now` and wait for the page to refresh. The old SSL certificate has now been removed from your load balancer and the new one applied

## Drain traffic from a particular target server

## Temporarily remove a target server from behind the load balancer

You may want to remove a target server from the load balancer to stop traffic going to it temporarily. For instance to run updates or to be able to restart the server.

This will immediately take the target server out of load. If you're using "Source" as a load balancing method to send users to the same target server each time, this could disrupt their session. You should first drain the server 

Navigate to the load balancer you want to edit in [MyUKFast](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/load-balancers) then click on `Target Groups` at the top of the load balancer screen

Click the target group which contains the target server which you want to temporarily remove

Click the `Targets` tab at the top of the screen

[![Target Group Overview](files/inactive_target_3_small.png)](files/inactive_target_3.png)

Click `Edit` next to the target server you want to remove from load, notice how it currently says `Active` next to
the target.

Uncheck the "Target is Active" box near the bottom of the form, then press save

[![Target Edit Screen](files/inactive_target_5_small.png)](files/inactive_target_5.png)

Notice that the tag in the target server you have just edited has changed to `Inactive` and you now have a message about
pending configuration updates to the load balancer. Click the `deployments screen` link

As long as the rest of your configuration is valid, you will see a `Deploy Now` button. Press this and wait for the screen to reload. Your changes have now been deployed to the load balancer and the target server you have edited will
no longer be recieving traffic.

To allow traffic to be sent to the server again, repeat the above steps but check the "Target is Active" box instead.
