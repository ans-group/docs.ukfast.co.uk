# Access IPs

You are able to use access IPs on listeners to block certain IPs from accessing your load balancer (block list) or only allow certain IPs to access your load balancer (allow list).

To get started go to the listener you want to change the access IP settings for within the [load balancers section](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/load-balancers) of MyUKFast.
