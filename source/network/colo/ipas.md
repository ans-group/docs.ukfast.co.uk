# Can I bring my IP ranges and AS number with me?

If you're an existing or prospective colocation client with UKFast, then yes, you may. If you have your own IP ranges but no AS number, you can edit your RIPE database, so that your IP address ranges will be announced under our AS number 34934.

If you have your own AS number and wish to setup a BGP session with us, please edit your RIPE database to indicate that you will peer with us. Please be aware that BGP setup may incur service surcharge.
