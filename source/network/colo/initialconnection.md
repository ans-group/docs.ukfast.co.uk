# Initial connection to the UKFast colo network

1. Please notify us one business day before you connect your devices to the UKFast network so that we can enable your ports ready for you to connect.

2. Please be aware that ports are configured to accept layer 3 devices only e.g routers or a routed mode firewall.  If it's a layer 2 device e.g. a switch or a transparent firewall, then port will be disabled automatically.

3. If you have ordered dual links from us and will connect them to a fail over pair of firewalls or similar, please let us know so that we can adjust our configuration accordingly.
