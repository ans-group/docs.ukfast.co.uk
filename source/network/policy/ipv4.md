# <nospell>IPv4</nospell> addresses on the UKFast network.

The bread and butter of the routable internet, chances are pretty high you'll be using an <nospell>IPv4</nospell> address somewhere on your solution. Here are some of the more frequently asked questions regarding them:

## Can I have more <nospell>IPv4</nospell> address than I got in my initial allocation?

* Yes, Please raise this with your account manager and fill in the RIPE form with details

* Please be aware that <nospell>IPv4</nospell>  addresses now are limited resources, so we do need detailed reasons for what you need them for. For example. if you're requesting an address just for a new site and it's associated SSL, it's working looking into `SNI` which is pretty much globally accessible these days.

## What if I need IP addresses from 2 different Class C ranges for SEO purposes?

Good news, you don't! There's no real concept of classed IP addresses any more. All <nospell>IPv4</nospell> ranges are now under the VLSM scheme (Variable Length Subnet Masking). Google PageRank based SEO isn't based on different IP address ranges any more as far as anyone knows.
