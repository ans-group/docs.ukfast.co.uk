# IPv4 addresses on the UKFast network.

The bread and butter of the routable internet, chances are pretty high you'll be using an IPv4 address somewhere on your solution. Here are some of the more frequently asked questions regarding them:

## Can I have more IPv4 address than I got in my initial allocation?

* Yes, Please raise this with your account manager and fill in the RIPE form with details

* Please be aware that IPv4  addresses now are limited resources, so we do need detailed reasons for what you need them for. For example. if you're requesting an address just for a new site and it's associated SSL, it's working looking into `SNI` which is pretty much globally accessible these days.

## What if I need IP addresses from 2 different Class C ranges for SEO purposes?

Good news, you don't! There's no real concept of classed IP addresses any more. All IPv4 ranges are now under the VLSM scheme (Variable Length Subnet Masking). Google PageRank based SEO isn't based on different IP address ranges any more as far as anyone knows.
