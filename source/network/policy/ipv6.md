# <nospell>IPv6</nospell> on UKFast solutions

* UKFast network is <nospell>IPv6</nospell> enabled network. At the moment <nospell>IPv6</nospell> is available upon request. Please be aware that it may incur additional cost to enable <nospell>IPv6</nospell> on a client solution.

* Each Client will be assigned a `/64` <nospell>IPv6</nospell> range by default.  If you don't currently have a range assigned please contact your UKFast account manager or raise a support ticket via [MyUKFast](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/pss/add.php)

* At the moment, all UKFast services, such as monitoring may not fully support <nospell>IPv6</nospell> functionality. We are working on the process of enabling <nospell>IPv6</nospell> across all our additional services and will introduce them in the near future.
