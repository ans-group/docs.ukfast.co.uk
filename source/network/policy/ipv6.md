# IPv6 on UKFast solutions

* UKFast network is IPv6 enabled network. At the moment IPv6 is available upon request. Please be aware that it may incur additional cost to enable IPv6 on a client solution.

* Each Client will be assigned a `/64` IPv6 range by default.  If you don't currently have a range assigned please contact your UKFast account manager or raise a support ticket via [MyUKFast](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/pss/add.php)

* At the moment, all UKFast services, such as monitoring may not fully support IPv6 functionality. We are working on the process of enabling IPv6 across all our additional services and will introduce them in the near future.
