# UKFast-supported VPNs

There are three different types of VPNs we support if your servers are behind a UKFast dedicated firewall:

- **Site to Site VPN:** This type of VPN is mainly used for connecting between two physical locations e.g. your office to a UKFast data centre. You will need a firewall/router to support IPSec site to site VPN at your office/other location.

- **Traditional IPSec remote access VPN:** This VPN is used for connecting a mobile device to your UKFast solution behind a dedicated firewall. It will support Microsoft Windows XP / 7 (32bit/64bit) / Linux / MacOS.

- **WebSSL VPN:** This VPN is used for connecting a mobile devices to your UKFast solution behind a dedicated firewall. It will support Microsoft Windows XP / 7 (32bit/64bit)/ 10 / Linux / MacOS.


If your servers are behind UKFast shared firewalls, we will not support the creation of VPNs. However we will be able to open ports for customers who run VPN termination on your servers.
