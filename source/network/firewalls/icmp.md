# Enabling ICMP to UKFast servers

All UKFast-hosted servers have ICMP PING enabled outbound by default.  

All inbound ICMP traffic from the public Internet, and outbound traceroute ICMP traffic, are disabled by default.  If you wish to enable either inbound ICMP PING or traceroute for your solution, and you are using a dedicated firewall, please [raise a support ticket in MyUKFast](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/pss/add.php).

If your solution is behind a shared firewall, we will not be able to enable inbound ICMP to your server for security reasons.
