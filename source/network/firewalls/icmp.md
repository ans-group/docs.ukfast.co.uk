# Can I enable ICMP to my servers

* All servers have ICMP PING enabled outbound by default

* All inbound ICMP traffic from public and outbound traceroute ICMP traffic are disabled by default

* If your solution is behind a shared firewall, we will not be able to enable inbound ICMP to your server for security reasons.

* If you solution is behind a dedicated firewall, please raise a ticket from your client area to request either inbound ICMP PING or Traceroute to be enabled for your solution.
