# How do I schedule a reboot for my firewall?

Firewall reboots should be done through [MyUKFast](https://my.ukfast.co.uk). Navigate to `Products and Services` >> `Firewalls` >> `Dedicated`. You should see the following screen:

Select the firewall that you would like to reboot and choose the time. Click `Schedule Reboot`.


# What if my firewall needs upgrading?

If you are running the Java-based ASDM to manage your firewall, or AnyConnect VPN with either SSL or IKEv2, your firewall needs updating.

Your UKFast support team has uploaded the latest imaging software to resolve this bug. All you need to do is schedule your firewall to be restarted for this change to take effect.  After this update is complete all functions will continue as normal.
