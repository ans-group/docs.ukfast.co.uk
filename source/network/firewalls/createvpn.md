# How can I setup a VPN if I have a dedicated firewall?

1. WebSSL VPN & IPSec Remote Access VPN

    Please raise a ticket within the MyUKFast Portal and an engineer will set it up for you. The first 5 instances of this will be free, but further setup may incur a charge.

2. Site to Site IPSec VPN

    Please raise a ticket within the MyUKFast Portal. An engineer will send you a VPN form to start with. Please fill in that form and return to us. We will setup the VPN based the information you have provided. In this case, the first 2 instances will be free, but further setup may incur a charge.
