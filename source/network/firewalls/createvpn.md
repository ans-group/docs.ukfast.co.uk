# Setting up a VPN on a dedicated UKFast firewall

You can still use a VPN with a dedicated firewall, simply follow the steps below to set one up.

## 1. WebSSL VPN and IPSec Remote Access VPN**

Please [raise a ticket within MyUKFast](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/pss/add.php) and a UKFast support engineer will set this up for you. The first five instances of this will be free, but further set ups may incur a charge.

## 2. Site to Site IPSec VPN**

Please [raise a ticket within MyUKFast](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/pss/add.php). A UKFast support engineer will send you a VPN form to start the process. Please complete this form and return to us, and we will setup the VPN based the information provided. In this case, the first two instances will be free, but further set ups may incur a charge.
