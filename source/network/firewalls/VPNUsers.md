# User Administration For AnyConnect VPN

If you have an AnyConnect VPN setup on your dedicated firewal you can edit the user configuration via the online editor.  You can 
add a user, remove a user, change passwords and/or group-policy for a user all via the MyUKFast VPN Users tab.

## Add a New User

Once on the VPN tab, click the **Details** button in the **Remote Access** section.  You will then see an option to **Add New User** near the top of the page.

Fill in the fields given and select the group-policy you would like applying to the new user (there may only be one in the list).  Then 
click **Add User**.

Please note, the change is not made to the firewall until you click **Apply Changes**.

## Editing an existing User

To edit an existing user click the user name in the list of users on the VPN Users tab.  This will give a page to make changes to passwords and/or group-policy.
