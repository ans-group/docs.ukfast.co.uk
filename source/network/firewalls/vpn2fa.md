# Do you support two factor authentication (2FA) VPN?

Yes, we support SSL two factor authentication for SSL VPN setups. It can either based on certificates or based on [Duo Security](https://duo.com/). If you choose to use Duo, it requires that you install the Duo app on your mobile phone.

This may be a chargeable service, so it's worth contacting your account manager to discuss this further.
