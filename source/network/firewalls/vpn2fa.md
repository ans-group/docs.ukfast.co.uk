# Do you support two factor authentication VPN?

Yes, we support SSL two factor authentication for SSL VPN setups. It can either based on certificates or based on Duo Security (this method requires that you install an app on your mobile phone).

This may be a chargeable service, so it's worth contacting your account manager to discuss this further.
