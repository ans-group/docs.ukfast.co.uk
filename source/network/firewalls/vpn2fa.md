# Two factor authentication (2FA) VPNs

SSL two factor authentication (2FA) can be enabled for SSL VPN setups. This can either be based on certificates, or on a third party service called [Duo Security](https://duo.com/). If you choose to use Duo you will need to install the Duo app on your mobile phone.

This may be a chargeable service - please [contact your UKFast account manager](https://portal.ans.co.uk/account/your-account-manager.php) to discuss this further.
