# Managing Passwords

There are several passwords which control access to different parts of your solution and MyUKFast account. Knowing where they are, how to access them and how to get them changed is a vital part of keeping your solution secure.

## Server Passwords

Passwords to access your server via SSH, RDP, FTP, MySQL and any panel product you may have installed can all be located by going to the **Server** or **eCloud** tab within [MyUKFast](https://my.ukfast.co.uk) 

To access your server credentials, browse to the Server or eCloud tab within MyUKFast and select your server's IP address from the list presented to you.

You will then need to scroll down to the Unlock Credentials button at the very bottom of the page. Enter your MyUKFast password and your server credentials will be displayed to you.
