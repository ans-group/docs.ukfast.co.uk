# Support Requests

Support requests are the best way to provide our engineers with information about a complex issue you've been having even if you're planning on calling up as they allow us to have all the information about a problem and potential solutions in one place and give you a reference number for your records.

## Raising a Support Request

To raise a support request first log in to [MyUKFast](https://www.my.ukfast.co.uk) with your MyUKFast Account password

Next select **Support > Create a Request** on the left hand side of the page, this will generate a page asking you to enter information relevant to your issue.


### Product / Service

It's important that this section is filled in as accurately as possible as it directs your request to the correct team(s) and ensures your issue gets looked at as quickly as possible.

Selecting anything other than **General Enquiry** will load another drop down menu asking you to select which specific product from the category you had selected previously your issue is regarding.

### Request Details

The subject and message sections here are important as they are often all the information our engineers have to go off when diagnosing your issue and ensuring a speedy resolution so please make sure to put as much relevant information as you can in here.

If you're unsure whether something is relevant or not, include it in the message with context as it's always better to have too much information than too little.

### Priority

This section determines the amount of time we have to respond to your request and the priority which it is given in our job distribution system.

* Normal = Non service-affecting issues that don't have a specific time within which they need to be resolved.

  e.g. I would like to optimise the load time of my website, is there anything you can recommend?

* High = Service affecting or issues that need to be resolved / work that needs to be completed within a specific time frame.

  e.g. I need to upgrade my database engine by next week, can I get this work booked in with on of your engineers?

* Critical = This is only to be used if a solution is down, correct usage of this means that we are able to quickly identify and deal with issues that are causing a lot of disruption and in doing so we can limit damage caused to your reputation

  e.g. I cannot SSH into my server and my websites are down


### Attachments

Attaching additional information to your ticket in the form of an email or screenshot can speed up resolution or help you when an issue is hard to describe.

Our support system currently accepts `.gif`, `.jpg`, `.png`, `.bmp`, `.txt`, `.doc`, `.docx`, `.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.csv`, `.pdf`, `.zip` and `.msg` files up to a maximum size of 2MB

### Notification Settings

These settings allow you to control who is notified when we reply to your support request and how this notification gets delivered.

In the **CC Responses To** box you can enter email addresses separated by a semi-colon of people you wish to be copied in to our replies

The **Reply Security** options allow you to change between responses only being delivered through [MyUKFast](https://my.ukfast.co.uk) (though you'll still receive an email notification letting you know there is a reply awaiting you) or through email as well. For increased security we recommend only having ticket replies delivered through [MyUKFast](https://my.ukfast.co.uk) as this allows us to encrypt everything.

The **Preferred Contact Method** drop down box allows you to let the engineer dealing with your issue know whether you would like to be contacted back on the ticket primarily or called on your default contact number. If you change this from the default ticket response we would recommend that you mention you would like to be called back by the engineer in the request's message section also.
