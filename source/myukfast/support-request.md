# Support Requests

Support requests are the best way to provide our engineers with information about a complex issue you've been having, even if you're planning on calling up, as they allow us to have all the information about a problem and potential solutions in one place, as well as giving you a reference number for your records.

## Raising a Support Request

To raise a support request, first log in to [MyUKFast](https://portal.ans.co.uk) with your MyUKFast Account password

Next, select **Support > Create a Request** on the left hand side of the page. This will generate a page asking you to enter information relevant to your issue.

### Product / Service

It's important that this section is filled in as accurately as possible. Having all the information in the ticket allows us to direct your request to the correct team(s), and ensures your issue gets looked at as quickly as possible.

Selecting anything other than **General Enquiry** will present another drop down menu, allowing you to further categorise your ticket.

### Request Details

The subject and message sections here are important. They are often all the information our engineers have to go off when diagnosing your issue, so make sure to put as much relevant information as you can to help ensure a speedy resolution.

If you're unsure whether something is relevant or not, include it in the message with context anyway, as it's always better to have too much information than too little.

### Priority

This section determines the amount of time we have to respond to your request, and the priority it will be given in our ticket system.

* **Normal** = Non service-affecting issues that don't have a specific time frame within which they need to be resolved.

  e.g. I would like to optimise the load time of my website. Is there anything you can recommend?

* **High** = Service-affecting issues or issues that need to be completed within a specific time frame.

  e.g. I need to upgrade my database engine by next week. Can I get this work booked in with one of your engineers?

* **Critical** = This is only to be used if a solution is down. Correct usage of this allows us to identify and deal with serious disruptions like outages more quickly, limiting their impact.

  e.g. I cannot SSH into my server and my websites are down.

### Attachments

Attaching additional information to your ticket in the form of an email or screenshot can speed up resolution, and can help when an issue is hard to describe.

We currently support attachments up to 2MB in the formats `.gif`, `.jpg`, `.png`, `.bmp`, `.txt`, `.doc`, `.docx`, `.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.csv`, `.pdf`, `.zip` and `.msg`

### Notification Settings

These settings allow you to control who we notify and how when we reply to your support request.

In the **CC Responses To** box you can enter the email addresses of people you wish to be copied into our replies, using a semicolon to separate each of them.

The **Reply Security** options allow you to change how we notify you of support Ticket updates.

* If "Replies must be made through MyUKFast" is set, we will send you an email to tell you we have replied, and you will need to log into [MyUKFast](https://portal.ans.co.uk) to view it.
* If "Replies can be made through MyUKFast or email" is set, we will send you the message content via email, and you will also be able to reply back using email.

For increased security, we recommend only having ticket replies delivered through [MyUKFast](https://portal.ans.co.uk), as this allows us to keep all communication encrypted.

The **Preferred Contact Method** drop down box allows you to tell us whether you would like to be contacted back on the ticket or called on your default contact number. If you change this from the default ticket response, we would recommend that you mention you would like to be called back in the request's message body also.
