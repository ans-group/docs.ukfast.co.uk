# Plesk SafeDNS Extension

## Info & Troubleshooting

The UKFast SafeDNS Plesk extension provides the ability to manage the SafeDNS Zone for any of the domains on your Plesk Server.

It will synchronise the DNS Zones from Plesk with SafeDNS.
It does not replace or modify Plesk’s internal DNS, so if you have specific domains which use an external DNS Service, you’re free to continue using that service.

When a task is run, logs are generated in the following directory. 
If there is an issue which is not clear based on the failure notification, then check these logs:
```console
 /var/log/plesk/ext-plesk-safedns/
```

```eval_rst
.. warning::
    At present, this extension is **only compatible with linux systems**.
    Usage on windows will result in synchronise tasks erroring & no logs being written by the extension.
```

```eval_rst
.. note::
    DDoSX Will be implemented in a future release.
```
