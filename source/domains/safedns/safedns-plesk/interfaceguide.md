Enabled                                      Domains must be enabled here to work with the extension.

Sync Now                         | This will push an enabled zone to SafeDNS.
                                 |
                                 | If a record already exists, it will be updated to match plesk.
                                 |
                                 | If a record exists on SafeDNS but has been removed, (or didn't exist) on Plesk, it will be deleted

Last Synchronise                 When a domain is Synchronised, this is updated with the date & time

Automatic Sync (on zone change)  When Plesk's internal DNS is updated, the domains that have this enabled, will be automatically Synchronised with SafeDNS.

Delete Zone (From SafeDNS)       Deletes the zone from SafeDNS. Only if the zone is enabled.
