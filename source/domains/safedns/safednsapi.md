# SafeDNS API

The SafeDNS API allows you to manage DNS records through a programatic inteface exposed over `HTTPS`.
This in essence allows your developers to integrate your applications into the SafeDNS platform
and modify DNS records automatically. The documentation can be found [HERE](https://developers.ukfast.io/services/safedns)

```eval_rst
.. warning::
  The SafeDNS API allows for a lot of control over your domains, do not give out API keys to individuals you do not trust.
```

```eval_rst
.. warning::
  Please read the documentation carefully, failure to do so may mean your domain's DNS doesn't function in a way you intend. Always test!
```
