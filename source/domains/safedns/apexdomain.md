Your domain apex is the second (or third, depending on the TLD) level domain that is provided by your domain registrar. This is the domain that has your `NS` and `SOA` records set to.

For example, these are apex domains:

* `ukfast.co.uk`
* `ukfast.com`
* `ukfast.io`
* `ukfast.me.uk`

These are _not_ apex domains:

* `images.ukfast.co.uk`
* `www.ukfast.co.uk`
* `webmail.ukfast.com`
=======
Your domain apex is the secord or third level domain that is provided by your domain registrar. This is the domain that has your NS and SOA records set to.
