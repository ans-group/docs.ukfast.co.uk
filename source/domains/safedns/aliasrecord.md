```
### Why should you use an `ALIAS` record over a `CNAME` record?

`ALIAS` records are used to overcome a limitation of the `CNAME` record. From the [RFC2181](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2181#section-10.1):

> 10.1. CNAME resource records
>
>   The DNS CNAME ("canonical name") record exists to provide the canonical name associated with an alias name. There may be only one such canonical name for any one alias.

Which means you can't have another record along with a `CNAME` record. For example, this would be an invalid configuration:

```none
www.example.org 300 IN CNAME example.org
www.example.org 300 IN TXT "some text"
```

However you can't just remove all records from your [apex domain](https://docs.ukfast.co.uk/domains/safedns/apexdomain.html) when you want to use the `CNAME` record. This would  break another RFC from the [Zone authority section](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2181#section-6.1):

> The authoritative servers for a zone are enumerated in the `NS` records for the origin of the zone, which, along with a Start of Authority (`SOA`) record are the mandatory records in every zone.

You have a mandatory `NS` and `SOA` record on your [apex domain](https://docs.ukfast.co.uk/domains/safedns/apex-domain.html), so if using a `CNAME` too there is an invalid configuration. This is where the `ALIAS` record comes in, to help work around this problem.

If you want to use a domain name that been provided by a CDN / DDoS provider on your [apex domain](https://docs.ukfast.co.uk/domains/safedns/apex-domain.html), SafeDNS allows you to set the `ALIAS` record and we will return the address records. For example:

```none
example.org 300 IN ALIAS example.com
```

In that example, when you look up `example.org`, we will return the `A` and (if configured) the `AAAA` records of `example.com`.

```eval_rst
.. note::
  The ``ALIAS`` record is not an official type under the RFC, so where possible you should use the ``CNAME`` record
```
