    This guide is only for domains that have already been transferred to UKFast. If you're not there yet, you can follow our guide here:

    - :doc:`/domains/domains/transferin`
```

To change nameservers, you'll first need to login to the [MyUKFast Panel](https://my.ukfast.co.uk). Once logged in, navigate to the following location:

`Products & Services` > `Domains`

Once here, select the domain you're looking to modify the nameservers for and select the `nameservers` tab

On this page you should see a list of your existing nameservers. To change these, simply delete the existing records from their field, replace these with your new nameservers and save your changes.

Please note, this change can take upto 24 hours before it is reflected correctly.
