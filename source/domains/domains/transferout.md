# Transferring a Domain away from UKFast

```eval_rst
.. note::
   This process contains a lot of the same steps as our article on transferring domains into UKFast, just from the inverse perspective:
   - :doc:`/domains/domains/transferin`
```

## `.uk` domains

To transfer a `.uk` domain away from UKFast go to `Domains` > `Transfer out`, or follow [this link](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/domains/transfer_out_stage1.php). Here you can to select the domain(s) you wish to transfer away from UKFast from the left hand list, move it to the list on the right, and hit the Next button.

On the next page you will need to enter the `IPS tag` of the registrar you are transferring the domain to. Start typing into the bar to bring up the tags of different registrars, which you can then select from. If you don't know this tag, it's worth contacting your new registrar to confirm which tag to use.

When you are done, the tag will be changed automatically. However, in some cases the new registrar will ask for a `handshake`, which means that they need to approve the transfer in before it is final. If this is the case an information box will notify you of this, and the transfer will be pending their acceptance.

## Non `.uk` domains

To transfer a non-`.uk` domain away from UKFast you will have to go through the transfer in process with your new registrar.

Before you can do that you need to get the domain's `EPP code` from us. In Domains > Transfer Out follow the process to choose the domain which you are moving away from us. This will unlock the domain so it can be moved away.

You will need to confirm the registrant contact details, as the EPP code you will need is sent to them. Then also confirm the admin contact. It's very important that this email address is valid and a managed inbox, as the emails related to the transfer approval will be delivered there.
