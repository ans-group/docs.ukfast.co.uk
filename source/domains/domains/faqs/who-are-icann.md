ICANN, short for &lsquo;The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers', are a not-for-profit organisation that controls the rules and regulations with regards to [(domain names)](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/faq/view/1251.html).


They regulate the registration and the use of domain names for the [(Generic Top Level Domains)](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/faq/view/1253.html), such as .com, .net or .org., and are in the process of rolling out a huge number of new TLDs.


Registrars and registries have to comply with the rules set by ICANN, applying them to you - the registrant. In a push to tidy up domain name registration information and ensure that all details are up to date and accurate they have recently added extra checks and procedures for registrants to confirm details. Failure to do so on new registrations or changes of details leads to the domain being suspended.
