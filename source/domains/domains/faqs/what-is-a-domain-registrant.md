A domain registrant is the person who a :doc:`domain name</domains/domains/faqs/what-is-a-domain-name>` is registered to and therefore, in effect, owns it. They will be the person who applied to a registrar for the domain and holds the right to use it.


If you're a registrant you will receive renewal and administrative notices for your domain and it will remain yours should you choose to renew it when it comes to expire.


The registrant of a domain can usually be found by using a WHOIS lookup. However for some domains registrants can buy domain privacy protection or opt out of the WHOIS database.
