# How do I check if my domain registrar is UKFast?

If you have a `.uk` domain and you want to check who your registrar is, you can use our [WHOIS service](http://www.ukfast.co.uk/whois.html) to find out.

If the `TAG` is `UKFAST` then it means your domain is hosted with us.

For all other domains you can use WHOIS to find out who your registrar is.

The registrar for any UKFast domains will be either Enom or Tucows.

```none
Domain Name: UKFAST.COM
Registry Domain ID: 10737741_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN
Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.enom.com
Registrar URL: www.enom.com
```

However, the quickest and easiest way to find out is to go to the domains section on MyUKFast.

There it will tell you if the domain is with us. You can then edit its details and name servers, and will have the option to renew the domain.
