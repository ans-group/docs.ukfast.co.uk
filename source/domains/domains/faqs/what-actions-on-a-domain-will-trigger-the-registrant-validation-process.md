Any new domain registration or transfer in, as well as the update of contact details (first name, last name or email address) will cause the validation process to begin. A WDRP or mandatory renewal reminder bounce-back will also cause this to happen.


If a previously validated record exists for that combination of first name, last name, and email address, the domain will be considered validated and no further action is required. If an exact match does not exist, the registrant will be sent an email asking them to validate their first name, last name, and email address. For example, John Doe john@doe.com is different from Johnathan Doe john@doe.com and both will require separate validation.
