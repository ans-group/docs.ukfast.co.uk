Before the release of the new gTLDs, [ICANN](/domains/domains/faqs/who-are-icann) began to tidy up the domain registration rules, as previously lots of inaccurate information was causing problems.


The new rules boil down to:


1. Validating the registrant email address during the purchase, transfer or modification of a domain. Failure to respond to the validation within 15 days may lead to suspension of the domain.


2. The same process occurs if a WHOIS Data Reminder Policy email bounces, so it's important to ensure that the WHOIS data provided is also correct.


3. Registrars must ensure that all address and contact information provided is correct and formatted properly.
