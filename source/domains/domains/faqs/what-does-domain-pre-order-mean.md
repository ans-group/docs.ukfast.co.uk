If you wish to reserve a domain before it is officially released, you can pre-order it through some registrars.


When you pre-order a domain name your registration request will be queued and be processed as soon as the domain becomes available to the general public. Orders are processed at the registry on a first come, first served basis; and if there is more than one order for the same name, the first order to be placed will be able register the name (unless there are special conditions, such as with the [(.london domain allocation)](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/faq/view/1307.html)).


Should your request be unsuccessful credit will be applied on your account.
