If you are a domain name registrant you will receive a WHOIS Data Reminder Policy (WDRP) email asking you to check that the contact information associated with your domain name(s) is all up to date and correct.


Registrants will be sent a WDRP email 120 days before a domain's expiry date. If a domain is registered for more than one year, the WDRP message is sent, each year, 120 days before the anniversary date of the domain's registration.


In order to update your contact information in the WHOIS database, you will need to contact your registrar (or your reseller if you registered your domain name through a reseller).

Should the reminder email bounce then the domain registrant validation process will be triggered and if not verified within 15 days the domain name will be suspended.
