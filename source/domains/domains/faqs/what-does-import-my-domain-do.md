Import my domain adds your domain record into MyUKFast, but it's important to bear in mind that it does not **transfer** the domain.


It's primarily used if you transfer, or are going to transfer, a `.uk` domain to us. You can import it via Domains > Import a Domain. Then once you have changed the tag you will be able to manage it through MyUKFast.


To import a non `.uk` domain you can follow the instructions found in [How do I transfer a domain to UKFast](/domains/domains/faqs/how-do-i-transfer-a-domain-to-ukfast).
