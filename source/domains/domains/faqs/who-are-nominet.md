Nominet is an internet :doc:`registry</domains/domains/faqs/what-is-a-domain-registry>` company in the UK. It manages the .uk domain space, and from 2014 will run .cymru and .wales too.


Registering and renewing these domains are done through one of the many registrars (like UKFast) that work with Nominet.


Nominet will sometimes contact the registrant directly should there be a problem with a domain, or if the domain is coming up for renewal. Registrants also get an online control panel to update their contact details.


Registrar changes can also be done via Nominet if a registrar is unable or unwilling to assist, but a fee is charged.
