Domain names are identifying words that we link to websites' numerical addresses. We do this so we don't have to remember their IP addresses, which are long strings of numbers.


For example, if someone told you to go to address 64.233.160.0 etc. you'd probably be pretty unhappy; it's much easier when they say go to Google.com!
