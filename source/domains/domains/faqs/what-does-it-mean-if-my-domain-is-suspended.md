If you are a domain registrant, you will receive emails asking you to validate your email address; if you fail to reply to the validation email (or the renewal reminders) then the registry will suspend your domain after 15 days.


If your domain is suspended the registry will interrupt the domain name system (DNS) and prevent the domain from resolving (making contact with your website's IP address). It will then be placed on ClientHold and an internal WHOIS Lock.


If your domain is with UKFast and you want to remove the suspension you can resend the validation email to yourself in the View Domain Overview screen in MyUKFast. You can also change the email address that receives the email from the View Domain Registrant screen.
