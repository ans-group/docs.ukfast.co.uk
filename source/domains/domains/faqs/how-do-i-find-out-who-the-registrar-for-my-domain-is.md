To find out the registrar for a .uk domain you can use our [WHOIS look up tool](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/domains/tools/) the tag will identify your registrar. 

If you are unsure of your registrar's tag, you can look it up in [Nominet's list of registrars](http://www.nominet.org.uk/uk-domain-names/registering-uk-domain/choosing-registrar/list-registrars).

For all other domains, you can still find the information through WHOIS, but in some cases you may have to go through an extra step to identify the company that registered your domain for you.

This is because many companies offer domain registration through one of the larger domain registrars such as TUCOWS or ENOM.

The WHOIS tool should show who your primary registrar is, and from there you can then go to their site where they will usually have a  ""find your domain provider"" tool. By entering your domain here it should tell you who the registrar is for that domain.
