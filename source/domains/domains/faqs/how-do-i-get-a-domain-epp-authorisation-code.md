If your domain is managed by UKFast simply complete the [domain transfer out process in MyUKFast](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/domains/transfer_out_stage1.php) to obtain your EPP code.


The registrant of the domain will then receive the EPP code via the email, so please make sure that the domain information provided is correct or you will not receive it.

If your domain is not with UKFast you must request the code from your current domain's registrar; many registrars have a process within their customer control panel to tell you where you can do this.
