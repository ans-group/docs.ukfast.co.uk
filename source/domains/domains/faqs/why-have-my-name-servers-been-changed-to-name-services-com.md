For certain non-.uk domains, if it has not been renewed by the expiry date, it is considered to be expired and ceases to operate. The name servers are automatically updated to dns1.name-services.com, dns2.name-services.com and the domain will redirect to a parking page until the domain is renewed or deleted. Upon successful renewal, the name servers are restored to their original settings.
