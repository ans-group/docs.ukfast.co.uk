In most cases, the admin contact for the domain will receive the transfer authorisation email.

For some domains that do not have an admin contact, it will go to the domain owner/registrant. 

If your domain is managed by UKFast you can [change the admin contact in MyUKFast](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/domains/index.php) by selecting the domain in Domains and editing the contact information.

If your domain is not managed by UKFast, see your registrars help guides on how you can change usually via their control panel.
