# What is an SLD?

A Second Level Domain (SLD) is the part of the address that comes directly before the [Top Level Domain (TLD)](/domains/domains/faqs/what-is-a-tld), and usually provides more information on the organisation that registered the domain.

In many cases the SLD is the middle bit of a domain that goes between `www.` and the domain name extension (for example, `.com`, `.org`) at the end of the address. For example, in <www.ukfast.co.uk>, `ukfast` is the SLD.

However, it can also come after the dot to tell you more about the type of entity the domain belongs to. For example, in the `.uk` namespace, a university or other academic institution would register under `.ac.uk`, instead of `.co.uk`, as it signposts that the organisation is a learning institution. In this case, `.ac` is the SLD.
