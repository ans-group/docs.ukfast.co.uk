A Second Level Domain (SLD) is the part of the address that comes directly before the :doc:`Top Level Domain (TLD)</domains/domains/faqs/what-is-a-tld>`, and usually provides more information on the organisation that registered the domain.


In many cases the SLD is the middle bit of a domain that goes between &lsquo;www.' and the domain name extension (for example, .com, .org) at the end of the address. For example, in [www.ukfast.co.uk](http://www.ukfast.co.uk), &lsquo;ukfast' is the SLD.


However it can also come after the dot to tell you more about the type of entity the domain belongs to. For example, in the .uk namespace, a university or other academic institution would register under .ac.uk, instead of .co.uk, as it signposts that the organisation is a learning institution. In this case, &lsquo;.ac' is the SLD.
