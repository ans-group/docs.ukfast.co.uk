To add a domain to your MyUKFast account you can use the import domain function in [Domains > Import a Domain](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/domains/import.php).


This will add it to our system, however, to manage the domain you must first [transfer it to us](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/faq/view/1311.html).
