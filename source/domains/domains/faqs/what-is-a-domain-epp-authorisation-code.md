An EPP code - or authorisation code - is a unique code given to each domain by its [(registrar)](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/faq/view/1259.html) as an extra level of security, much like a password.


If you want to transfer your domain to a new registrar, you need to give them your EPP; you can get it from your current registrar.
