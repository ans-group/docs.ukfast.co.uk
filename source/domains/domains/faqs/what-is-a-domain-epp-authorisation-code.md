An EPP code - or authorisation code - is a unique code given to each domain by its :doc:`registrar</domains/domains/faqs/what-is-a-domain-registrar>` as an extra level of security, much like a password.


If you want to transfer your domain to a new registrar, you need to give them your EPP; you can get it from your current registrar.
