If you are transferring a domain to UKFast and the authorisation email is not responded to within 14 days, you will need to restart the transfer process.

To do this in MyUKFast go to [Domains > Transfer In Status](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/domains/transfer-in-status-inprogress.php). 

Here you will have the option to resend the authorisation email (if it has not yet been 14 days and the process hasn't failed yet), or to restart the process. By choosing the latter the system will re-check use the current administration contact details on the WHOIS, and send out the owner authorisation email again to them.
