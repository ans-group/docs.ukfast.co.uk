A domain registrar is a company that offers :doc:`domain name</domains/domains/faqs/what-is-a-domain-name>` registration, often on behalf of others. For example, GoDaddy.com is one of the most famous (and biggest) registrars.


If you buy a domain name through one registrar you can switch to another; which you might do because of competitive pricing, features, or a problem with the registrar.


UKFast offers over [(130 domain extensions)](https://www.ukfast.co.uk/domain-names.html), and you can transfer in from another registrar.
