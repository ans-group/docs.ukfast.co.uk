To transfer a .uk domain to UKFast from another registrar you just need to change the IPS tag to UKFAST using your current provider or Nominet; then [import the domain in MyUKFast](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/domains/import.php). The change usually happens within minutes.

For a non .uk domain the process is slightly more complicated. First, ensure the domain's administrative contact has a valid email address using our [WHOIS tool](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/domains/tools/); if it's incorrect or out of date, please update the information through your current registrar first.

You will then need an authorisation (EPP) code from your current registrar. Some domains may not require one, but if they do you will need to enter this code from the authorisation email in order for the transfer to proceed.

Once you have all the required information, go to [Domains > Transfer In](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/domains/transfer-in.php), fill in the domain names you wish to transfer to us and complete the transfer in process. A charge may apply for the transfer, as the domain will often be renewed for one year once the transfer is complete.

An email will be sent to the domain's WHOIS admin contact to approve the transfer, and fill in the EPP code. The registry will then approve the change.

This process could take up to 5 days to complete, but usually it happens much quicker than that once its approved by the owner.
