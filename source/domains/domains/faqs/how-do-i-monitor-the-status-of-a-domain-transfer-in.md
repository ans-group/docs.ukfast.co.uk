You can monitor the status of any domains you are in the process of transferring to UKFast by going to [Domains > Transfer In Status in MyUKFast](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/domains/transfer-in-status-inprogress.php).

From this page you can also resend verification emails and restart the transfer process.
