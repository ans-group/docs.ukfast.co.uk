You can manage who receives domain renewal reminders under the Support tab, in the [MyUKFast Alerts Manager](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/alerts-manager/index.php). If you have several contacts you can select who you wish to receive the reminders under Product Renewal.

If no one is selected, they will automatically go to the Primary Contact, which you can under [My Account > Overview > Contacts](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/account/list-contacts.php).
