Now there is a huge array of TLDs available the grace and redemption periods vary for each. 

Typically for non-.uk domains, your domain will stop resolving as soon as it expires. 

In some cases the domain's name servers are be updated and your domain will redirect to a parking page approximately 1-3 days after expiry. 

Your domain then enters into a grace period, in which you may renew the domain at the standard price and the original name servers will be subsequently restored. 

After the grace period, your domain enters a redemption period where the domain can be renewed for a higher cost. 

When this period is over, the domain cannot be renewed and will eventually become available for registration to anyone else at some point after that.

Most non .uk domains have a grace period of 40 days followed by a redemption of 30 days. 

For a full reference of all domain TLDs view this [Domain TLD Reference Chart](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13t4l-kO3qAio4RCF3j1lF0X2AxaIr_G5kFIqIF3LAZU/edit) provided by domain registrar OpenSRS.


For .uk domains the process is slightly different:

After your domain name expiry date you have 30 days grace before it's suspended. After this point, any emails and websites you had set up on it will go offline. 

The domain name will then be in suspension for another 60 days before being deleted, at which point it becomes available to anyone for re-registration. You can renew the domain at no extra charge any time during this 90 day period.

Please note that other TLDs and domain registrars may have different policies and timeframes concerning expiration and renewal.
