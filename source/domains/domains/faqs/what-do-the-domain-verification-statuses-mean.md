* Pending --The validation process has been initiated, and the validation email will be sent.
* Verifying --The validation process has been initiated and is waiting for registrant response.
* Verified --The registrant has been validated.
* Manual Review --The registrant data has been submitted and is being validated manually by the Tucows Compliance team.
