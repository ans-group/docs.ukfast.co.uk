# What is a domain/IPS tag?

An Internet Provider Security (IPS) tag, also known as a registrar tag, domain tag, Nominet provider tag, or `IPS` key, is a unique code issued by Nominet to domains. Every `.uk` domain is assigned one to identify which registrar has control of that domain.

IPS tags are a single sequence of numbers and/or letters that are capitalised. For example, UKFast's tag is `UKFAST`.

The registrar that controls the domain gives the registrant the ability to update their domain information, including contact details, the name servers it points to and handles its renewal.

All registrars which host `.uk` domains must have an IPS tag. You can search for a registrar and their tag on the [Nominet site](http://www.nominet.org.uk/uk-domain-names/registering-uk-domain/choosing-registrar/list-registrars).

If you want to transfer from one registrar to another, your original registrar would need to change the tag to that of your new one.
