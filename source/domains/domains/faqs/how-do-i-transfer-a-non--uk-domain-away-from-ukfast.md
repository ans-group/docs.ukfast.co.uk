To transfer a non-.uk domain away from UKFast you will have to go through the transfer in process with your new registrar.

Before you can do that you need to get the domain's EPP code from us. In [Domains > Transfer Out](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/domains/transfer_out_stage1.php) follow the process to choose the domain which you are moving away from us. This will unlock the domain so it can be moved away.

You will need to confirm the registrant contact details, as the EPP code you will need is sent to them. Then also confirm the admin contact as the transfer approval emails go to this address.
