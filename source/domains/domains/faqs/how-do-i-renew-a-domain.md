There are three ways that you can renew domains with UKFast.

Firstly, you can set your domains to :doc`Auto Renew<how-do-i-set-my-domains-to-auto-renew>` 

You can also renew them when nearing expiry through MyUKFast. 

In your list of domains under the Domains tab, it will highlight the ones that are about to expire in red, and under Status will say expiring'. 

Select the domain you wish to renew, or use the Advanced Filter option to see all the domains that are about to expire. 

Then you can use the tick box to select the ones you want to renew, and select Renew Now. Note: you will only be able to see the renewal option when the domain is within the renewal window.

We also send email reminders when domains are about to expire. The emails will contain a unique link asking you to Renew Now; the link will take you to a secure, external page where you can renew your domain(s).
