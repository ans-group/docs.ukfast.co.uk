We will attempt to renew your domain name at various times before it is due to expire; with the first attempt 60 days before expiry.


If payment fails we will inform you and will re-attempt the renewal at the next milestone. The milestones we check for domains to auto-renew are 30, 14, and 7 days before the expiry, and then on the day of expiry itself.


We also send a reminder that your domains will auto-renew seven days before we attempt to renew them just in case you wish to stop them from auto-renewing.
