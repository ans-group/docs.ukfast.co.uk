Firstly, you need to provide at least two, and at most six, (2-6) functional nameservers per domain.

Also, if the domain name is registered and the nameservers are not active, you have 30 days to activate and park the name on them.

If this doesn't happen DENIC (Manager of .DE domains) deletes the domain name without refund.

You can modify the nameservers associated with the domain name during the 30-day period. However, the modifications have to be verified by DENIC, otherwise they will be rejected.
