Upon registration request .ltd.uk (Private Limited Companies)/.plc.uk (Public Limited Companies)/net.uk (Internet Service Providers' infrastructure) domains are manually checked by Nominet to ensure they meet their strict <a href=""http://www.nominet.org.uk/uk-domain-names/registering-uk-domain/choosing-domain-name/rules"">domain name requirements</a>.


As the process is manual it may take a little extra time; especially if you made the request in the evening or at the weekend.


If your domain is still not showing as registered, try checking our <a href=""https://my.ukfast.co.uk/faq/view/1262.html"">.ltd.uk</a>, <a href=""https://my.ukfast.co.uk/faq/view/1263.html"">.plc.uk</a>, or <a href=""https://my.ukfast.co.uk/faq/view/1270.html"">.net.uk</a> special requirements FAQs; we will also contact you if there are any problems with your registration.
