Upon registration request .ltd.uk (Private Limited Companies)/.plc.uk (Public Limited Companies)/net.uk (Internet Service Providers' infrastructure) domains are manually checked by Nominet to ensure they meet their strict <a href="http://www.nominet.org.uk/uk-domain-names/registering-uk-domain/choosing-domain-name/rules">domain name requirements</a>.


As the process is manual it may take a little extra time; especially if you made the request in the evening or at the weekend.


If your domain is still not showing as registered, try checking our :doc:`.ltd.uk</domains/domains/faqs/what-are-the-special-requirements-for-registering-a--ltd-uk-domain>`, :doc:`.plc.uk</domains/domains/faqs/what-are-the-special-requirements-for-registering-a--plc-uk-domain>`, or :doc:`.net.uk</domains/domains/faqs/what-are-the-special-requirements-for-registering-a--net-uk-domain>` special requirements FAQs; we will also contact you if there are any problems with your registration.
