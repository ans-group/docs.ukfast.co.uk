3.Enter your desired domain name in the search bar. You will then see if that domain and any possible extensions are available. This section will also let you know the price for the domain, depending on how many years you wish to reserve it for; and you can buy multiple domains at a time.


Note: If you would like to purchase one of the new release gTLDs the registrant will need to confirm it before it can be fully registered.


Add your chosen option to your basket and it will appear on the right hand side.
