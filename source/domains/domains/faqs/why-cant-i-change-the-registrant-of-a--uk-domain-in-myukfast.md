To change the registrant of a `.uk` domain you need to complete the transfer process through Nominet. Please note there will be a fee of £10 VAT.


To do this, access your [Nominet account](https://secure.nominet.org.uk/auth/login.html) and select Your Domains > Registrant Transfer tab. You can then select the domain name(s) you would like to transfer; and confirm the new registrant's email address, and who will pay the transfer fee.


When you have completed the information, a confirmation email will be sent to the new registrant, so it's important to ensure that all contact details are correct and up to date. The new registrant will have five days to agree the transfer.


If the registrant accepts, you will get an email confirming the process is complete. If they don't agree within this window, Nominet will issue a refund and you will have to restart the process if you still want to transfer the registrant.


You can change all other information regarding your domain in MyUKFast.
