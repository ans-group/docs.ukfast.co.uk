Due to new rules introduced by ICANN, all registrant contact details must now be validated when a domain is registered, transferred; or any changes made to the registrant's first name, last name or email address. This verification helps to ensure that any changes or purchases are made by the real person, and not a pesky imposter. If these details aren't kept up to date you risk your domain being suspended.


When you perform one of the actions above, an email will be sent to the registrant address to validate and confirm that the first name, last name, and email address are all correct.


If the details are not confirmed on the Domain Admin portal within 15 days, the domain will be suspended and placed on `Client Hold`, rendering the domain name inactive.


Reminder emails are resent to the registrant on days five, 10 and 13 within the 15 day validation window.


On days 10 and 13 reminders are sent to the Admin, Tech and Billing contacts to let them know the domain has still not been validated.


This same process will take place if a "WHOIS Data Reminder Policy" (WDRP) notice, 30 day expiration notice or five day expiration notice bounces.


For domains registered with UKFast: When viewing a domain, extra information will be presented to you to let you know that the registrant contact has not been validated and you have the ability to resend the validation e-mails again.


If your domain is suspended you can remove the suspension by resending the validation email via the View Domain Overview screen in MyUKFast. You can also change the email address that receives the email from the View Domain Registrant screen.


There is no impact to existing domains as long as they are not modified and WDRP/expiration notices do not bounce; and you do not have to retroactively validate previously registered domain names, as of January 2014.
