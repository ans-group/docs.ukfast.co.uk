For certain non-.uk domains, if it has not been renewed by the expiry date, it is considered to be expired and ceases to operate. Three days after the expiry date, the name servers are automatically updated to ns1.renewyourdomain.net and ns2.renewyourdomain.net and the domain will redirect to a parking page until the domain is renewed or deleted. Upon successful renewal, the name servers are restored to their original settings.
