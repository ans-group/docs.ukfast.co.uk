If you try to register a new gTLD domain name that matches a trademark that has been registered with the Trademark Clearinghouse (TMCH), you will be warned that the name has a trademark registered against it. If you continue with the order, the trademark holder will be notified that a domain has been registered that matches their mark, and they may choose to dispute that registration.


This Trademark Claims notification service continues for 90 days after each new TLD is made available to the general public.


When registering a domain in MyUKFast, a TM icon appears next to any available domain that matches a registered trademark. Once your purchase is complete you will receive an additional email with terms and conditions to accept before the registration is completed.


Here's an example of the agreement page:
