If you no longer need your domain and wish to stop receiving alerts for it you can simply delete the domain. In the main Domains tab you will see a list of your current, live domains. Select the one(s) that you wish to delete, and in the top right hand corner of the screen will be a bin icon and "delete domain".


To delete several domains quickly, you can also tick multiple domains on your domains list, and then select Delete at the bottom!


After you have deleted the domain you will no longer receive alerts for it from UKFast
