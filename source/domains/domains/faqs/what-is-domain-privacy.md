This option allows you to replace your real contact details on the :doc:`WHOIS</domains/domains/faqs/what-is-whois>` database with a proxy, to keep your details private. If anyone needs to contact you, correspondence will be sent through the proxy.


Certain domain :doc:`registries</domains/domains/faqs/what-is-a-domain-registry>` charge for this service and some offer it for free.


Privacy can also be enabled after registration; however, you will still be charged the full amount no matter how close you are to the renewal date. You will also always be charged on the renewal date if it still enabled, regardless of when it was enabled. You can purchase it through UKFast for £;3 per year when you register a domain name; and then your account will be charged £;3 each year when the domain is renewed, if it is still enabled.


Privacy can be removed and re-added for no extra cost at any time up until the next renewal date.


If you want to transfer your domain to a new registrar, domain privacy will usually need to be disabled so that important domain messages can be sent and received.
