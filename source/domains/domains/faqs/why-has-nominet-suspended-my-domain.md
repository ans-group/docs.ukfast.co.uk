Nominet may suspend a domain for several reasons:


If Nominet is required to contact the registrant in order to verify the contact details provided, and the registrant fails to respond, the verification process will not be completed and result in suspension of the domain.

If a domain is registered against a company that becomes insolvent or closes, the domain is automatically suspended.

If the domain is not renewed, it will become suspended 30 days after the expiry date.


If your domain has been suspended by Nominet, you may be able to lift the suspension by verifying the registrant contact details you have provided and submitting the changes. If this fails to resolve the issue or you have any further questions about your suspension, please [contact Nominet directly](http://www.nominet.org.uk/who-we-are/contact-us).
