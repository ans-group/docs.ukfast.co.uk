A domain registry holds a database of domain names, and information that goes with them, like who owns it and when it expires. Each registry maintains different TLDs, for example, Nominet looks after .uk :doc:`domain names</domains/domains/faqs/what-is-a-domain-name>` and DENIC does the same for .de in Germany.


Some registries sell domain names directly (like SWITCH in Switzerland) but many use authorised resellers (or registrars) who you buy and register domain names through.


Some domain name registries are government departments (e.g., the registry for Sri Lanka nic.lk), whereas others are co-operatives of internet service providers (such as DENIC). There are also not-for-profit companies (which include Nominet UK) and others who operate as commercial organizations, such as the US registry (nic.us).


Each registry allows a user to query their database of domain names via the WHOIS system, which lets users to check availability or find out who owns a particular domain.
