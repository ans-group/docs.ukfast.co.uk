A ccTLD is a Country Code Top Level Domain.


It's the two letters following a domain name that represent a country, sovereign state, or dependent territory, for example .au is Australia, .uk is the UK.


We use ccTLDs because they give us more information about the site that we're visiting; in this case, the geographical origin of the site.


They function as part of the internet system we use to help us map and remember site's numerical addresses - also called the Domain Name System (DNS). ccTLDs aren't part of ICANNs new TLD rollout, and there's an application process if you want to establish a new one.
