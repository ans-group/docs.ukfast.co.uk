[Nominet](/domains/domains/faqs/who-are-nominet) have special requirements that a `.plc.uk` (limited) domain must meet before they will register it. As an overview you can only register a `.plc.uk` domain if:

* The registrant is a limited company and has ""public limited"" or ""plc"" in their company name
* The registrant has a valid company registration number
* The domain being registered must closely match the company name (excluding the words ""limited"" or ""ltd"" on the end, and ""The"" at the start, and ""&"" and "" "" will be replaced by ""and""). All punctuation marks will also be removed.


For the full rules see [Nominet's site](http://www.nominet.org.uk/uk-domain-names/registering-uk-domain/choosing-domain-name/rules).
