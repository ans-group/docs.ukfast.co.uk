# What are the special requirements for registering a `.ltd.uk` domain?

[Nominet](/domains/domains/faqs/who-are-nominet) have special requirements that a `.ltd.uk` (limited) domain must meet before they will register it. As an overview you can only register a `.ltd.uk` domain if:

* The registrant is a limited company and has limited or Ltd in their company name
* The registrant has a valid company registration number
* The domain being registered must closely match the company name (excluding the words ""limited"" or ""ltd"" on the end, and ""The"" at the start, and &ldquo;&amp;&rdquo; and &ldquo; &rdquo; will be replaced by ""and""). All punctuation marks will also be removed.

For the full rules see [Nominet's site](http://www.nominet.org.uk/uk-domain-names/registering-uk-domain/choosing-domain-name/rules).
