:doc:`Nominet</domains/domains/faqs/who-are-nominet>` have special requirements that a .ltd.uk (limited) domain must meet before they will register it. As an overview you can only register a .ltd.uk domain if:

<ul>
<li>The registrant is a limited company and has limited or Ltd in their company name</li>
<li>The registrant has a valid company registration number</li>
<li>The domain being registered must closely match the company name (excluding the words ""limited"" or ""ltd"" on the end, and ""The"" at the start, and &ldquo;&amp;&rdquo; and &ldquo; &rdquo; will be replaced by ""and""). All punctuation marks will also be removed.</li>
</ul>

For the full rules see [Nominet's site](http://www.nominet.org.uk/uk-domain-names/registering-uk-domain/choosing-domain-name/rules).
