If you want to change the registrant for .uk domains you or the new registrant need to complete a form with Nominet - the internet registry for the .uk domain extensions. To do this you need to log in to your [Nominet Online Services](https://secure.nominet.org.uk/auth/login.html) account and select the 'Registrant Transfer' service.

To change the registrant is Â£10 plus VAT, which can be paid for by either the existing or new owner.

When you have filled in the details, confirmation will be sent to the new registrant. The new registrant has five days to agree to the transfer; if this doesn't happen, Nominet will issue a refund and - if you still want to change the registrant - you will have to start the process again.

If the new registrant accepts the transfer, you will receive an email confirmation when they have completed the process.

You can find more information on [Nominet UK's website](http://www.nic.uk/registrants/maintain/transfer/).
