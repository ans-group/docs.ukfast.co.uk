When a domain is registered, transferred, or  registrant contact information updated, the registrant will be sent an email asking them to validate their first name, last name, and email address.


The email contains a verification link, and when clicked takes the registrant to a page that displays the email address, first and last name that are being used for the domain registrant details. It  includes a link to the domain registration terms and conditions and a checkbox that they must click to indicate that they agree to those terms and conditions. Failure to respond to this email will result in the domain being suspended. The validation page will look like this:
