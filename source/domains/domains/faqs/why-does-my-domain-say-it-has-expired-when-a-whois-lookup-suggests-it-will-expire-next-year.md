For non-`.uk` domains, when a domain expires the registry may automatically add an additional year onto the expiry date, which can be seen in the WHOIS results. However, the domain still requires renewal and if it is not done within 40 days, the domain will go into redemption for another 30 days - the domain can still be renewed, but typically for a much higher cost.



If your domain is within MyUKFast, we will show you the actual expiry date.
