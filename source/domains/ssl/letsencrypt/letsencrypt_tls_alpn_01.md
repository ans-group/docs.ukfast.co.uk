# Let's Encrypt Revocation of TLS-ALPN-01 Validated Certificates

## Overview

On ***26th January 2022***, Let's Encrypt notified customers via email that on ***28th January 2022*** they will revoke any certificates issued in the last 90 days and validated by the [TLS-ALPN-01 challenge](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#tls-alpn-01). Irregularities were discovered in Let's Encrypt's implementation of the [TLS-ALPN-01 challenge](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#tls-alpn-01), and as such any certificates issued *prior to 26th January* using **TLS-ALPN-01** are to be considered misissued.

This revocation only affects certificates issued and validated with the [TLS-ALPN-01](https://letsencrypt.org/docs/challenge-types/#tls-alpn-01) challenge. Unless you receive an email regarding this from your ACME SSL provider/client then you ***do not need to take any action***.

```eval_rst
.. warning::
   You are not impacted if using Certbot, ACME.sh, AutoSSL or SSLit!
