# ACME.sh

`acme.sh` is a simple Let's Encrypt client written in shell script. Compared to its counterparts, such as the popular Certbot, it is much more lightweight on the system and has the ability to be customised. As it's a shell script, the dependencies are minimal. Any server with `bash`, `sh` or `zsh` is compatible with this client.

More details on the project can be seen on the official repository <https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh>.

## Installation

One of the benefits of `acme.sh` is that it can be run and installed as any system user. However, it is recommended to install it as `root`. It's important to note that `acme.sh` does not officially work with `sudo`. There is a work around for this, but it is not recommended, so the first step would be to either sign in as `root` or escalate privileges with this command:

```bash
sudo -i
```

Most systems come with `git` pre-installed, but to ensure it is installed, we can do the following:

* For RHEL based systems (e.g. CentOS, Alma):

```bash
yum install git
```

* For Debian based systems (e.g. Ubuntu):

```bash
apt-get install git
```

Now we need to clone the `acme.sh` repository locally and move into the directory:

```eval_rst
.. note::
    Please note this will clone the repo to your current working directory. You may choose to clone to ``/tmp`` so the repo files will automatically be cleared.
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh.git
cd acme.sh/
```

For the next command, the following flags can be adjusted to your preference:

- `--home` | This is where `acme.sh` will be installed including any API plugins.
- `--config-home` | This is where the config files for certificates will be stored (e.g. renewal hooks)
- `--cert-home` | This is where the certificates themselves will be stored.
- `--accountemail` | This will be the address renewal messages will be sent to.

```eval_rst
.. note::
    It's important that the email set for ``accountemail`` is a valid address as Let's Encrypt will send reminder emails should a certificate not get renewed, which is usually an indication of a problem.
```

An example of an install command would look something like this:

```bash
./acme.sh --install --home /etc/acmesh --config-home /etc/ssl/data --cert-home /etc/ssl/certs --accountemail "example@example.com"
```

You will likely see this warning when installing the client.

```
.. note::
   It is recommended to install ``socat`` first. We use ``socat`` for standalone mode. If you don't use standalone mode, just ignore this warning.
```

This warning only applies if the server you are installing the client on **does not** have a web server (such as NGINX) installed.

The install process will create a `bash` `alias` for the client for you, as well as setting up a cron job to automate the renewal of certificates. Once the install is complete, there are two final steps before we can issue certificates. First, we need to log out and log back in to apply the `bash` `alias`, then we need to register the Let's Encrypt account.

```eval_rst
.. note::
    Its important to ensure that the email used here is the same used to configure acme.sh with.
```

```bash
acme.sh --register-account -m example@example.com
```

## Issuing a certificate

There a couple of different options that `acme.sh` supports for issuing certificates. Below we will cover the main three which are `webroot`, `apache` and `nginc`. `acme.sh` also has integration with many different DNS providers. More information on these can be seen at <https://github.com/acmesh-official/acme.sh/wiki/dnsapi>.

## `webroot`

`webroot` verification involves placing a verification file in the document root of the site. This it then polled by the CA to verify you have control over the domain, at which point it will issue the certificate. Normally with paid certificates this is a manual process, however, `acme.sh` takes care of this all automatically.

For `webroot` verification you will need to know the document root of your site. You can usually find this information from your web server config files, although commonly they are found in the `/var/www` directory.

Once we know where the document root, is we can begin with issuing certificates.

For securing a standard website with `www.` and non-`www.`

```eval_rst
.. note::
    Replace ``<webserver>`` with the web server you are using. This will likely be NGINX or Apache. This ensures the service is restarted when the certificate is renewed.
    Apache's service name also changes depending on the OS it is installed on. For Debian variants (e.g. Ubuntu) this is ``apache2``. For RHEL variants (e.g. Alma) this is ``httpd``.
```

```bash
acme.sh --issue -d example.com -d www.example.com -w /path/to/doc/root --reloadcmd "systemctl reload <webserver>"
```

For a single subdomain you can use the following example:

```bash
acme.sh --issue -d test.example.com -w /path/to/doc/root --reloadcmd "systemctl reload <webserver>"
```

## NGINX

`acme.sh` also has an NGINX mode. This will only work if you are **currently** running NGINX on port 80

For securing a standard website with `www.` and non-`www.`

```bash
acme.sh --issue -d example.com -d www.example.com --nginx --reloadcmd "systemctl reload nginx"
```

For a single subdomain you can use the following example:

```bash
acme.sh --issue -d test.example.com --nginx --reloadcmd "systemctl reload nginx"
```

## Apache

`acme.sh` also has an Apache mode. This will only work if you are **currently** running Apache on port 80

For securing a standard website with `www.` and non-`www.`

* On RHEL based systems (e.g. CentOS, Alma):

```bash
acme.sh --issue -d example.com -d www.example.com --apache --reloadcmd "systemctl reload httpd"
```
* On Debian based systems (e.g. Ubuntu):

```bash
acme.sh --issue -d example.com -d www.example.com --apache --reloadcmd "systemctl reload apache2"
```

For a single subdomain you can use the following example:

* On RHEL based systems (e.g. CentOS, Alma):

```bash
acme.sh --issue -d test.example.com --apache --reloadcmd "systemctl reload httpd"
```

* On Debian based systems (e.g. Ubuntu):

```bash
acme.sh --issue -d test.example.com --apache --reloadcmd "systemctl reload apache2"
```
