# How to secure your sites with Let's Encrypt on Ubuntu

You can install the certbot utility in `Ubuntu` using the official PPA (Personal Package Archive) from `certbot`.

First, install the **software-properties-common** package, if you don't already have this.

```
apt install software-properties-common
```

Next, install the repo, update the apt database and install the module for your chosen web service. 

For `apache`

```
add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
apt update
apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache
```
or for `nginx`
```
apt install python-certbot-nginx
```

There after you can use the same methods to install a certificate as previously mentioned for [Apache](/domains/ssl/letsencrypt/letsencrypt_centos_apache.html#installation) and [Nginx](/domains/ssl/letsencrypt/letsencrypt_centos_nginx.html#installation)
