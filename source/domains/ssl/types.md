SSL Certificates come in various forms, which provide the different features that may be required by your business. The different types of SSL available through UKFast are:

**Single-Domain SSLs - covers www.domain.com and domain.com**
- FastSSL - Trusted by all popular browsers, automated validation.
-  SGC SLL -  The Server Gated Cryptography (SGC) SSL Certificate upgrades the encryption capabilities of older browsers from 40-bit into 128/256-bit. This means you achieve 99.9% browser recognition.
 - Symantec Secure Site Pro - This website security solution features true 128-bit encryption, the Norton Secured Seal, vulnerability assessment, and website malware scanning to help you take action against critical website weaknesses.


**Multi-Domain SSLs - lets you protect up to 100 different domain names on a single certificate**
- Multi-Domain SSL -  3 domains are included in the standard price, and additional domains can be added at a lower price than a single domain SSL.
- Unified Communications SSL - Users of Microsoft Exchange 2010/2013 or Office Communications Server 2007 are able to consolidate all certificates into a single, manageable UC Certificate.
- Extended Validation Multi-Domain SSL -  Like regular EV certificates (see below), EV Multi Domain SSLs also display the green HTTPS website address bar to visitors. 3 domains are included in the standard price and additional domains can be added at a lower price than a single domain SSL.

**Extended Validation (EV) SSLs - protects a single domain that requires business verification from the provider. This gives your website the green address bar**
- Extended Validation (EV) SSL - This certificate provides a visual trust indicator by turning the HTTPS address bar green - a feature exclusive to EV SSLs that indicates the site is verified and secure.
- Extended Validation SGC SSL - the addition of SGC technology to an EV certificate upgrades older browsers so they can connect at full 128- or 256-bit encryption levels.  This means you can convert more sales by protecting customers using these older browsers. As with the regular EV SSL certificate, a visual trust indicator is provided by turning the HTTPS address bar green.
- Symantec Secure Site Pro with EV - This website security solution features Extended Validation (EV), the green address bar, and the Norton Secured Seal.
    
**Wildcard SSL - A wildcard certificate protects a domain and unlimited sub-domains of that domain**
