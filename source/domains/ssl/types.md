SSL certificates come in various forms, which provide the different features that may be required by your business. The different types of certificates available through UKFast are:

**Single-Domain SSLs - covers `www.domain.com` and `domain.com`**
- `FastSSL` - Trusted by all popular browsers, automated validation.
- `SGC SSL` - The Server Gated Cryptography (SGC) SSL Certificate upgrades the encryption capabilities of older browsers from 40-bit into 128/256-bit. This means you achieve 99.9% browser recognition.
- `Symantec Secure Site Pro` - This website security solution features true 128-bit encryption, the Norton Secured Seal, vulnerability assessment, and website malware scanning to help you take action against critical website weaknesses.


**Multi-Domain SSLs - lets you protect up to 100 different domain names on a single certificate**
- `Multi-Domain SSL` - 3 domains are included in the standard price, and additional domains can be added at a lower price than a single domain SSL.
- `Unified Communications SSL` - Users of Microsoft Exchange 2010/2013 or Office Communications Server 2007 are able to consolidate all certificates into a single, manageable Unified Communications Certificate.
- `Extended Validation Multi-Domain SSL` - Like regular EV certificates (see below), EV Multi Domain SSLs also display the green HTTPS website address bar to visitors. 3 domains are included in the standard price and additional domains can be added at a lower price than a single domain SSL.

**Extended Validation (EV) SSLs - protects a single domain that requires business verification from the provider. This gives your website the green address bar**
- `Extended Validation (EV) SSL` - This certificate provides a visual trust indicator by turning the HTTPS address bar green - a feature exclusive to EV SSLs that indicates the site is verified and secure.
- `Extended Validation SGC SSL` - the addition of SGC technology to an EV certificate upgrades older browsers so they can connect at full 128-bit or 256-bit encryption levels.  This means you can convert more sales by protecting customers using these older browsers. As with the regular EV SSL certificate, a visual trust indicator is provided by turning the HTTPS address bar green.
- `Symantec Secure Site Pro with EV` - This website security solution features Extended Validation (EV), the green address bar, and the Norton Secured Seal.

**Wildcard SSL - A wildcard certificate protects a domain and unlimited sub-domains of that domain**
