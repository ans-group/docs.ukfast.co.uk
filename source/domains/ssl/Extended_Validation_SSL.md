EV SSL certificates provide the highest level of trust, giving customers greater confidence that they are conducting business through a trusted websites. To be approved for the extended validation SSL certificate, there are first several steps and prerequisites that need to be completed. 

### Prerequisite's

1. The company must be registered on [Companies House](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/companies-house). If the client is ***not*** registered with **Companies House** they do not qualify for an `Extended Validation SSL Certificate`.

2. The company must have a listing with **Dun and Bradstreet**.
Comodo are looking for a DUNS number - found by requesting the company details on [Dun & Bradstreet](http://www.dnb.co.uk/) website. This is required for the final stage of validation.

### Complete the EV Docs

To begin the process for the `Extended Validation` checks, **Sectigo** require signed and completed Extended Validation Documents. Once completed, these should be submitted to evdocs@ukfast.co.uk. The forms contain:

* **EV SSL Certificate Request Form**
* **EV SSL Certificate Subscriber Agreement**

```

### Complete (DCV) Domain Control Validation

Once the EV docs have been submitted for review, complete the **Domain Control Validation (DCV).**

When purchasing the `Extended Validation SSL` the choice of **DNS**, **File upload** or **email validation** will have been selected for the **DCV** method.

Upon purchase, unique `SHA` and `MD5` hashes will be provided.
