    * Symantec Secure Site Pro - This website security solution features true 128-bit encryption, the Norton Secured Seal, vulnerability assessment, and website malware scanning to help you take action against critical website weaknesses.

* Multi-Domain SSL - A multi-domain certificate lets you protect up to 100 different domain names on a single certificate.
    * Multi-Domain SSL -  3 domains are included in the standard price and additional domains can be added at a lower price than a single domain SSL.
    * Unified Communications SSL - Users of MS Exchange 2010/2013 or Office Communications Server 2007 are able to consolidate all certificates into a single, manageable UC Certificate.
    * Extended Validation Multi-Domain SSL -  Like regular EV certificates EV Multi Domain SSLs also display the green HTTPS website address bar to visitors. 3 domains are included in the standard price and additional domains can be added at a lower price than a single domain SSL.

* Wildcard SSL - A wildcard certificate protects a domain and unlimited sub-domains of that domain.

* Extended Validation SSL - Protects a single domain that requires business verification from the provider. This gives your website the green address bar.
    * Extended Validation SSL - This certificate provides a visual trust indicator by turning the HTTPS address bar green - a feature exclusive to EV SSL that indicates that the site is verified and secure.
    * Extended Validation SGC SSL - EV SSL Certificates offer the highest assurance certificate available, with the addition of SGC technology it upgrades older browsers so they can connect at full 128- or 256-bit encryption levels meaning you convert more sales by protecting more customers than with a regular SSL Certificate. This certificate provides a visual trust indicator by turning the HTTPS address bar green - a feature exclusive to EV SSL that indicates that the site is verified and secure.
