## Purchasing

SSL certificates are available to purchase via [MyUKFast](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/ssl/buy.php)

Select the SSL certificate and click `Buy Now`. You'll then be asked to provide some information regarding the organisation responsible for the domain in question.

After this, you'll need to go through one of the validation processes outlined below, to confirm you're entitled to purchase an SSL certificate for the domain.

  * **File Upload** - You will need to upload a .txt file to the root of your website, which must be publicly accessible. Once validation is complete, this file can be safely removed.
  * **DNS Lookup** -  You will need to create a new CNAME record for your domain. Once validation is complete, this record can be safely deleted.
  * **Email** - An email will be sent to an administrative contact registered for the domain (you'll see a list of email addresses to choose from if this option is available).  You'll need to click on a link in the email.

Once validation is complete, a UKFast support engineer will be in touch if you've selected the option for UKFast to install the certificate for you.  If you've chosen to install the SSL certificate yourself, you'll find a link to the certificate in [MyUKFast](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/ssl/index.php)

## Renewing

We will send you a number of email alerts in the run up to your SSL certificate expiring.  Simply click the link in one of these emails and follow the process to renew your certificate within MyUKFast.  Alternatively you can login to [MyUKFast](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/ssl/index.php) and go to `Products and Services` then `SSL Certificates` to check when your certificates are due to expire, and manage their renewal.
