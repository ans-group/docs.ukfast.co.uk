Within the **Backup** tab of your server, navigate to **Backup Schedule** and select the blue pencil icon to modify.

## Schedule options

Backups are performed daily and retained for 7 days.

**Number of iterations** is the number of backups that are stored by your retention schedule. For example, retaining 7 iterations of a daily backup is a 7 day retention period. It is not currently possible to change the number of iterations or freqency.

**Manually Start Backup** schedules the backup to be executed as soon as possible by the server outside of the standard schedule.

```eval_rst
.. warning::
  Please note. a maximum of 7 backup iterations are retained, therefore your oldest backup will be lost when performing a manual backup.
```

**Backup Window** is a time period when the backup server will attempt to perform backups. This must be at least a 3 hour period to ensure that all backups can be queued and performed efficiently.

## Custom includes and excludes

Includes and excludes are directories, partial directories or wildcard file names that are explicitly included or excluded from your backup.

[Default includes and excludes](/dr-ha/ukfast_backup/getting_started.html#Default-includes-and-excludes) are setup automatically with your server and more rules can be added via MyUKFast.

## User defined includes and excludes

Navigate to the "custom includes/excludes section on the page and select `+ Add custom record` and follow the guidance below to create a rule."

Directories can be absolute like `C:/Users/WorkPC/Documents` or `/home/centos/documents` – this would backup the whole "Documents" folder. Wildcards can also be used `C:/Users/WorkPC/Documents/*.xlsx` or `/home/centos/documents/*.xlsx` – this would backup any `.xlsx` files in the "Documents" folder.
It is also possible to backup specific files from across the whole volume, for instance on linux systems `*.bin` would backup all `.bin` files from the volume, or `C:/*.docx` would backup all of the `*.bin` files on the C drive.

**Save** saves the current editable options on the screen.
