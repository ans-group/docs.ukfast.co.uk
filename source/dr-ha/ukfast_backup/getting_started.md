**Overview** provides information on your total, used and available backup quota and provides quick access to perform a full restore.

**Running jobs** is only visible when a backup or restore job is currently being processed.

```eval_rst
.. warning::
  Please note that Windows backups must wait for a system state to run on the client before files will begin to process, this often takes up to 20 minutes.
```
