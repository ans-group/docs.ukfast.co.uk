There are four alerts you can choose to set up, by ticking the relevant box:

- No backup for at least 7 days
- Restore job failed
- Backup job failed
- Backup job exceeding 24 hours

Each alert will be sent as an email to your registered email address in the event of a problem.

To stop receiving alerts, simply untick the relevant box(es).

## Setting up alerts for all computers or servers within your FASTcloudbackup end user account
