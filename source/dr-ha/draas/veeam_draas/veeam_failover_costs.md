# Failover costs
There are two different types of DRaaS solutions, Public and Private. This will give you a summary of how the DRaaS costs are calculated.

## DRaaS Public Solutions
DRaaS Public solutions replicate in to an eCloud Public environment in the given DRaaS region. This means that when you failover, your VMs will run on shared hypervisors.

In this scenario, there a few parts to the failover costings.

### Recurring costs
Customers will pay static monthly costs for:
- Per VM
- Per GB storage, at the 600 IOPS tier

### Failover Costs
When failed over, customers will pay based on our eCloud Public billing model, pro-rated hourly.

**Costs do occasionally change, so please get in touch with your Account Manager or Service Manager to receive the latest pricing.**

#### Compute costs
Customers will pay an hourly fee based on your VM specifications. This is per:
- 1 x vCPU
- 1GB RAM

#### Storage Costs
All customers pay a static monthly charge per GB for the storage they require in DRaaS. This price is based on the 600 IOPS tier.

If a customer decides to increase the IOPS tier to 1200 or 2500 on a VM, they will pay the difference in cost pro-rated hourly when they failover.

```eval_rst
**Costs used in example may not be correct**
For example, if the static storage cost paid is 20p per GB a month and the 1200 IOP tier costs 30p per GB a month.

The storage failover cost for VMs set to 1200 IOPS would be 10p per GB a month, pro-rated down to hourly.
```

## DRaaS Private Solutions

DRaaS Private Solutions have a dedicated eCloud solution in the DRaaS region, which will be paid for by the customer. Due to this, in most cases failover will not cost anything.

Every DRaaS private solution is different, so this should be confirmed with your Account Manager or Service Manager.
