# FastDrive

FastDrive is UKFast's cloud file sharing solution. Built solely for business use, FastDrive combines Citrix® ShareFile and UKFast's own cloud storage platform. FastDrive enables you to take control of business-critical data, with centralised storage and encrypted file sharing between colleagues and clients. Access your virtual data room from anywhere, on any device.

  Once FastDrive has been ordered, you'll need to provide the following: a custom subdomain, full name of users, email addresses and whether you'd like to custom brand (whitelabel) the user interface.
```
## Subdomain
When configuring your FASTdrive account you will be given the option by your Account Manager to specify your subdomain used to access the account. This will be <https://yoursubdomain.sharefile.eu/>.

If no subdomain is specified we will default to your company name, for example <https://yourcompany.sharefile.eu/>. Once deployed you do have the ability to add up to 2 additional sub domains for access via a number of URLs.

## What you'll get
Once the Launch process is complete, each user will receive an email link to activate their account. From that point they'll have access to FastDrive and can start creating folders/uploading data. This will also be explained to you if you've asked for a walkthrough with one of our FastDrive Support Engineers.
