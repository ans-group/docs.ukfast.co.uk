# FastDrive

When configuring your FASTdrive account you will be given the option by your Account Manager to specify your subdomain used to access the account. This will be https://yoursubdomain.sharefile.eu/. 

If no subdomain is specified we will default to your company name, for example https://yourcompany.sharefile.eu/. Once deployed you do have the ability to add up to 2 additional sub domains for access via a number of URLs.
