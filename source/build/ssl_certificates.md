   If you require any SSL Certificates as part of your solution, you can purchase these online via the MyUKFast Portal by going to https://my.ukfast.co.uk/ssl/buy.php 
```
We offer a range of certificates from Single Domain, Multiple Domain to Wildcard Certificates each ranging from Domain Control Validated to Extended Validated certificates.

**Single-Domain SSLs**

- FastSSL - Trusted by all popular browsers, automated validation.

**Multi-Domain SSLs - lets you protect up to 100 different domain names on a single certificate**

- Multi-Domain SSL -  3 domains are included in the standard price, and additional domains can be added at a lower price than a single domain SSL.
- Unified Communications SSL - Users of Microsoft Exchange 2010/2013 or Office Communications Server 2007 are able to consolidate all certificates into a single, manageable UC Certificate.
- Extended Validation Multi-Domain SSL -  Like regular EV certificates (see below), EV Multi Domain SSLs also display the green HTTPS website address bar to visitors. 3 domains are included in the standard price and additional domains can be added at a lower price than a single domain SSL.

**Extended Validation (EV) SSLs - protects a single domain that requires business verification from the provider. This gives your website the green address bar**

- Extended Validation (EV) SSL - This certificate provides a visual trust indicator by turning the HTTPS address bar green - a feature exclusive to EV SSLs that indicates the site is verified and secure.

**Wildcard SSL - A wildcard certificate protects a domain and unlimited sub-domains of that domain**

- Wildcard SSL - Secure unlimited subdomains over multiple servers on a single Wildcard SSL. For example: If you own www.yourdomain.com and have several subdomains such as secure.yourdomain.com, mail.yourdomain.com, etc. you can manage them all under one Wildcard SSL.

- Enterprise SSL Pro Wildcard - The Enterprise SSL Pro Wildcard certificate is a cost effective and efficient means of securing all subdomains without the need to manage multiple certificates. All the features and compatibility of Enterprise SSL Pro are included.
