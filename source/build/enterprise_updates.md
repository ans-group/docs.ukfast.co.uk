## Windows Updates

Any File or SQL Clusters in the solution will have the following Group Policy configuration:
- Auto Download and notify for install.

These updates will be then coordinated with yourselves to fail-over services and install/reboot (if required). 

All other single role Windows Servers will have the following Group Policy Configuration:
- Auto download and schedule the install.

These will be applied in one of the following 2 groups with times and days stipulated by UKFast to take in account redundancy of roles across VMs.
