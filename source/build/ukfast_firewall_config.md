# Firewall Configuration

Please find below the UKFast Default Firewall rules for Inbound and Outbound access. 
```eval_rst
.. warning::
   Please note: Once your solution has been deployed, we would recommend that you use the MyUKFast Firewall Editor to refine these rules to ensure your solution is a secure as possible, we would stongly recommend restricting the likes of RDP and SSH to specific IP addresses. 
```
## Default Firewall Rules
The following rules apply to all servers in the environment. Changes required for specific servers should be listed under the Custom Firewall Rules section of your Launch Questionaire.

If you have multiple VLANs as part of your solutions other ports may be required to internally between VLANs as part of the configuration and setup of the solution by UKFast, for example Active Directory. If so additional ports may be opened depending on the technical requirements of your solution.
