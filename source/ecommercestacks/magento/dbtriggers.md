# Database Triggers

When performing actions in the Magento admin area (Saving products for example) and you get a similar error message to:

```console
SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1449 The user specified as a definer ('username'@'localhost') does not exist, query was: UPDATE `catelog_product_entity` SET `attrivute_set_id` =?, `sku` =?, has_options` =?, `required_options` =?, `created_at` =?, `updated_at` =? WHERE(entity_id = '4062)
```

The database triggers may have been imported with the wrong User and Host defined. You can correct this with the following process:

### Export Database Triggers

Replace DBNAME with the database name in question:
```bash
~]$ mysqldump --triggers --no-create-info --no-data --no-create-db --skip-opt DBNAME > /tmp/DBNAME_triggers_export.sql
```

### Replace The Incorrect Username/Hostname

Review the file above and look for the DEFINER:

```bash 
~]# cat /tmp/DBNAME_triggers_export.sql | grep DEFINER
/*!50003 CREATE*/ /*!50017 DEFINER=`username`@`localhost`*/
```
We need to replace the username and hostname in the file /tmp/DBNAME_triggers_export.sql. View the User and Host Magento is connecting to the database with the following command:

```console
~]# mysql -e "show processlist;"
+--------+------------+-----------+---------------------------+---------+------+----------+------------------+-----------+---------------+
| Id     | User       | Host      | db                        | Command | Time | State    | Info             | Rows_sent | Rows_examined |
+--------+------------+-----------+---------------------------+---------+------+----------+------------------+-----------+---------------+
|   1132 | newusername | 22.93.135.106 | DBNAME | Sleep   |    0 |          | NULL             |         0 |             0 |
```

Replace the old username and host with the User and Host from the above command:

```bash
~]$ sed -i 's/username/newusername/g' /tmp/DBNAME_triggers_export.sql
~]$ sed -i 's/localhost/22.93.135.106/g' /tmp/DBNAME_triggers_export.sql
```

### Drop Database Triggers

Before you import the triggers that now have the correct username in, we need to drop the triggers with the wrong User and Host in the database. Replace DBNAME with the database name in question and run the following:

```bash
~]$ mysql -ANe "SELECT CONCAT('DROP TRIGGER ',trigger_name,';') FROM information_schema.triggers WHERE trigger_schema = 'DBNAME';" | sed s'/\|//g' > /tmp/DBNAME_drop_statement.sql
~]$ mysql DBNAME < /tmp/DBNAME_drop_statement.sql
```

### Import Triggers

Now the troggers have been removed from the database we need to import the triggers again with the correct User and Host:

```bash
~]$ mysql DBNAME < /tmp/DBNAME_triggers_export.sql
```
