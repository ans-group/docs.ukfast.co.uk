# Permissions Guide

The purpose of this guide is to show best practices for Magento 1 permissions. This is intended to ensure that the application is able to function without issue whilst ensuring that security standards are upheld.

```eval_rst
.. seealso::
   Note:
     The following information is for UKFast Magento 1 optimized servers running on the NGINX webservice - this guide is for NGINX only.
     If your configuration is bespoke or does not use our native stack we would recommend proceeding with caution.

     In the case that you have any queries please consult UKFast support.
```

First, we need to establish the root directory for your Magento 1 instance.  Typically this can be viewed in the NGINX configuration file located under:
/etc/nginx/conf.d/

```bash
grep root /etc/nginx/conf.d/mage.ukast.co.uk.conf
  root /var/www/vhosts/mage.ukast.co.uk/htdocs;
```

Next, to ensure we are able to set specific permissions we need to verify which user and group should be used. This is important as if the domain is a Magento multi-store, typically the owner and group would be the same for each virtual host as the document root is shared.

In this case PHP-FPM is utilized - this is configured as an upstream within Nginx -

```bash
grep ".sock;" /etc/nginx/conf.d/mage.ukast.co.uk.conf
server unix:/var/run/php-fpm-mageukastcouk;

grep php-fpm-mageukastcouk /etc/php-fpm.d/*.conf
/etc/php-fpm.d/mageukastcouk.conf:listen = '/var/run/php-fpm-php-fpm-mageukastcouk'

egrep "^user|^group" /etc/php-fpm.d/mageukastcouk.conf
user = mage.ukast.co.uk
group = mage.ukast.co.uk
```

Using all the information provided above, we can then input this into the commands for changing the document roots permissions.

```eval_rst
.. warning::
   **This allows you to revert your permissions back if required.**
```

```bash
getfacl -R /var/www/vhosts/mage.ukast.co.uk/htdocs > /var/www/vhosts/mage.ukast.co.uk/mage.ukast.co.uk-$(date +"%Y%m%d").acl
```

If this needs to be restored, the acl file can be used to restore the original permissions:

```bash
setfacl --restore=/var/www/vhosts/mage.ukast.co.uk/mage.ukast.co.uk-$(date +"%Y%m%d").acl
```

We can now proceed with updating the permissions. Please remember to change the root directory and user in accordance with the output of the previous commands.
```bash
chown -R mage.ukast.co.uk:mage.ukast.co.uk /var/www/vhosts/mage.ukast.co.uk/htdocs/
find /var/www/vhosts/mage.ukast.co.uk/htdocs/ -type f -exec chmod 440 {} \;
find /var/www/vhosts/mage.ukast.co.uk/htdocs/ -type d -exec chmod 550 {} \;
find /var/www/vhosts/mage.ukast.co.uk/htdocs/var/ -type f -exec chmod 660 {} \;
find /var/www/vhosts/mage.ukast.co.uk/htdocs/media/ -type f -exec chmod 660 {} \;
find /var/www/vhosts/mage.ukast.co.uk/htdocs/var/ -type d -exec chmod 770 {} \;
find /var/www/vhosts/mage.ukast.co.uk/htdocs/media/ -type d -exec chmod 770 {} \;
chmod 770 /var/www/vhosts/mage.ukast.co.uk/htdocs/includes
chmod 660 /var/www/vhosts/mage.ukast.co.uk/htdocs/includes/config.php
```

If not already added, you can add Nginx to the group used by PHP-FPM - here is the command to do so - this only needs to be performed once
```bash
usermod -a -G mage.ukast.co.uk nginx
```

To verify that this has been added to the group
```bash
id nginx
uid=10(nginx) gid=10(nginx) groups=11(mage.ukast.co.uk)
```

If the Magento site has CSS merging on you need the following additional permissions:
```bash
find var/www/vhosts/mage.ukast.co.uk/media/css -type d -exec chmod 750 {} \;
```

Then deploy your content, once deployed revert the permissions back
```bash
chown -R mage.ukast.co.uk:mage.ukast.co.uk /var/www/vhosts/mage.ukast.co.uk/htdocs/
find /var/www/vhosts/mage.ukast.co.uk/htdocs/ -type f -exec chmod 440 {} \;
find /var/www/vhosts/mage.ukast.co.uk/htdocs/ -type d -exec chmod 550 {} \;
find /var/www/vhosts/mage.ukast.co.uk/htdocs/var/ -type f -exec chmod 660 {} \;
find /var/www/vhosts/mage.ukast.co.uk/htdocs/media/ -type f -exec chmod 660 {} \;
find /var/www/vhosts/mage.ukast.co.uk/htdocs/var/ -type d -exec chmod 770 {} \;
find /var/www/vhosts/mage.ukast.co.uk/htdocs/media/ -type d -exec chmod 770 {} \;
chmod 770 /var/www/vhosts/mage.ukast.co.uk/htdocs/includes
chmod 660 /var/www/vhosts/mage.ukast.co.uk/htdocs/includes/config.php
```

Now the permissions for the site should be correct. However, if you are unsure about any of the above then please do not hesitate to get in touch with UKFast support and we can assist you further.
