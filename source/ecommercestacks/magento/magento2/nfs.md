# NFS

### Distributed Files/Folders
It's very important to only use NFS for files/folder which need to be distributed between multiple servers. We strongly advise against having the entire document root of your Magento website on NFS. For Magento2 the typical directories that need NFS are:

- pub/media
- pub/static

There are a number of ways in which you can achieve this.

#### Customize MAGE_DIRS
You can set MAGE_DIRS in any of the following ways:

##### Bootstrap Parameters
Please refer to the Magento guide on how to set the value of bootstrap parameters: [https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/config-guide/bootstrap/magento-how-to-set.html](https://devdocs.magento.com/guides/v2.3/config-guide/bootstrap/magento-how-to-set.html)

##### Custom Entry Point Script
You can use a custom entry point script such as the following:
```bash
use Magento\Framework\App\Filesystem\DirectoryList;
use Magento\Framework\App\Bootstrap;

require __DIR__ . '/app/bootstrap.php';
$params = $_SERVER;
$params[Bootstrap::INIT_PARAM_FILESYSTEM_DIR_PATHS] = [
 	    DirectoryList::PUB => [DirectoryList::URL_PATH => '',
 	    DirectoryList::MEDIA => [DirectoryList::PATH => '/nfsshare/media', DirectoryList::URL_PATH => ''],
 	    DirectoryList::STATIC_VIEW => [DirectoryList::URL_PATH => 'static'],
 	    DirectoryList::UPLOAD => [DirectoryList::URL_PATH => '/nfsshare/media/upload'],
 	    DirectoryList::CACHE => [DirectoryList::PATH => '/nfsshare/cache'],
];
$bootstrap = \Magento\Framework\App\Bootstrap::create(BP, $params);
/** @var \Magento\Framework\App\Http $app */
$app = $bootstrap->createApplication('Magento\Framework\App\Http');
$bootstrap->run($app);
```

#### Direct Mount Point
You can directly mount NFS to the folder within your document root:

```bash
NFSSERVER/nfsshare/media -> /var/www/vhosts/magentodomain.com/htdocs/pub/media
```
You can do this with the following entry in /etc/fstab:

```bash
 ~]# cat /etc/fstab | grep -i nfs
NFSSERVER:/nfsshare/media /var/www/vhosts/magentodomain.com/htdocs/pub/media nfs rw,noatime,nodiratime,async,timeo=1800 0 0
 ~]# mount /var/www/vhosts/magentodomain.com/htdocs/pub/media
```

#### Symlinks
You can symlink files/folders from your document root to the NFS mount point.

```bash
~]# ln -s /var/www/vhosts/magentodomain.com/htdocs/pub/media /nfsshare/media
```
