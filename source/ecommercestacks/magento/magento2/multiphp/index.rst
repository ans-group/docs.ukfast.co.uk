Multiple PHP Installations
=================================================

Guides to installing and running multiple versions of PHP on the same server. This is ideal for testing/switching to different versions of PHP with only a reload of Nginx required, so no downtime.

Once testing is complete we recommend changing the base install to the desired version and configuring the domain to use the base PHP version.
