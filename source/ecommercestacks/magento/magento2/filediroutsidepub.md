# File/Directory Outside /pub

If you have a file/directory you want to be accessible but is outside of the Magento 2 pub directory you need to edit your domains Nginx configuration (Example: /etc/nginx/conf.d/example.com.conf). 

### PHP Files

For this example we will use info.php which is located in /var/www/vhosts/example.com/htdocs/. This file will produce a 404 as it's not located in the pub directory (/var/www/vhosts/example.com/htdocs/pub/):

```bash
 ~]$ curl -I www.example.com/info.php
 HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
```

You can add the following to the domains Nginx configuration file anywhere within the server block:

```bash
~]$ vim /etc/nginx/conf.d/example.com.conf

# info.php outside of the pub folder
location /info.php {
    try_files $uri $uri/;
    location ~* \.php$ {
      fastcgi_pass replacemebackend;
      fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
      include fastcgi_params;
    }
  }
 ```
 
You need to edit replacemebackend with the PHP-FPM configuration pool name (This should be defined at the top of your Nginx configuration file). You also need to add info to the .php file allow list, we have a guide for this [here](/ecommercestacks/magento/magento2/nginxphpfileallowlist)

### Text / XML

For this example we will use sitemap.xml which is located in /var/www/vhosts/example.com/htdocs/. This file will produce a 404 as it's not located in the pub directory (/var/www/vhosts/example.com/htdocs/pub/):

```bash
 ~]$ curl -I www.example.com/sitemap.xml
 HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
```

You can add the following to the domains Nginx configuration file anywhere within the server block:

```bash
~]$ vim /etc/nginx/conf.d/example.com.conf

# sitemap.xml outside of the pub folder
location /sitemap.xml {
    root $MAGE_ROOT;
}
 ```

To implement this change you need to reload the Nginx service. First perform a configuration test with the following command:

```bash
 ~]$ nginx -t
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
```

If there are no errors in the configuration test, proceed to reload the Nginx service with the following command:

```bash
 ~]$ nginx -s reload
```

You should now be able to access sitemap.xml without any issues:

```bash
 ~]$ curl -I www.example.com/sitemap.xml
 HTTP/1.1 200 OK
```
