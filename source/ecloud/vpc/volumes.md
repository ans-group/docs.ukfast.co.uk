# Volumes

The storage for your instances are classed as a volume. You can create a volume as part of creating an instance or you can create these separately and attach them to an instance.

To create a volume Select 'Volumes' from the menu and then 'Create Volume'.

The volume will need an identifying name and a VPC to be assigned to. Select how much storage you require and the IOPS tier and click create volume.

Once the volume has been created, you can select the volume tile, click the 'attach' button and select the instance to assign this to from the dropdown list. The volume will then be available for the instance.
