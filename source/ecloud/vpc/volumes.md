The storage for your instances are classed as a volume. You can create a volume as part of creating an instance or you can create these seperately and attach them to an instance.

To create a volume Select 'Volumes' from the menu and then 'Create Volume' 

The volume will need an identifying name and a VPC to be assigned to. Select how much storage you require and the IOPs and click create volume.

Once the volume has been created you can select the volume tile > click the 'attach' button and select the instance to assign this to from the dropdown menu. The volume will then be available for the instance.
