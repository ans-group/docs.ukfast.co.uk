# VPNs

In eCloud VPC you have the ability to set up both Site-to-Site and Point-to-Site VPNs (Virtual Private Networks).

## Site-to-Site VPNs
Site-to-Site VPNs are used to connect two networks together over the internet, this is particularly useful for connecting
on-premises networks to your eCloud VPC networks.

Learn how to [set up a Site-to-Site VPN](/docs/ecloud/vpc/vpn/site-to-site-vpn/).


## Point-to-Site VPNs
Point-to-Site VPNs are used to connect individual devices to a private network from a remote location.
This allows remote workers who need to access resources on your eCloud VPC networks to connect securely.
