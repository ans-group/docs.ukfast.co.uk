# Reinstall OS

You can reinstall the originally selected OS of the virtual machine at any point by selecting the VM from the [MyUKFast VM list](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/ecloud-public) then the reinstall OS button shown below:

![reinstallOS](files/reinstallOS.png)

From here you will be prompted for your MyUKFast password as below:

![confirmReinstall](files/confirmReinstall.png)

This will then re-run our automation to present a fresh install of the operating system.
