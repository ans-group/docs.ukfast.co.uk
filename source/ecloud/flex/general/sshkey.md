# Adding a public SSH key to an eCloud Flex instance

If you would like a UKFast support engineer to troubleshoot issues on your eCloud Flex instance, you'll need to add a public SSH key and grant access to `ukfastsupport`.  Once you've [requested an SSH key via MyUKFast](/ecloud/flex/general/supportaccess), follow the steps below to add this to your instance.

Either login to the instance as root user, or prefix all commands with `sudo`:

1. Create the `ukfastsupport` user:

    ```bash
    useradd -m -s /bin/bash -G wheel ukfastsupport
    ```

    (For Debian/Ubuntu, replace `wheel` with `sudo`)

2. Switch to the ukfastsupport user:

    ```bash
    sudo -u ukfastsupport -i
    ```

3. Create the `.ssh` directory if it doesn't exist:

    ```bash
    mkdir /home/ukfastsupport/.ssh
    ```

4. Edit the authorized_keys file:

    ```bash
    nano /home/ukfastsupport/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```

5. Paste the key into the file ensuring that it's entirely on a single line. Save the file with CTRL+O then exit with CTRL+X.

6. Ensure the permissions on the files are set correctly - this must be done or SSH will deny access:

    ```bash
    chown -R ukfastsupport:ukfastsupport /home/ukfastsupport/.ssh
    chmod -R u+rwX,og-rwx /home/ukfastsupport/.ssh
    ```

If you run into any problems on this, please raise a support ticket via [MyUKFast](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/pss/create), or call support directly on 0800 230 0032.
