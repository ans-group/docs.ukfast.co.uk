# Working with eCloud Flex APIs

eCloud Flex provides access to the full range of OpenStack APIs, which is the most powerful way to take advantage of the capability available.  

There is a wealth of documentation and guidance available on the various OpenStack websites, including

* [OpenStack.org](https://www.openstack.org/)
* [Developer resources](https://developer.openstack.org/)

## Documentation for key OpenStack projects

The full set of OpenStack documentation including SDKs, Installation Guides and User Guides can be found on the [docs.openstack website](https://docs.openstack.org/newton/).

* [Compute](https://docs.openstack.org/nova/newton/)
* [Object Storage](https://docs.openstack.org/swift/newton/)
* [Block Storage](https://docs.openstack.org/cinder/newton/)
* [Identity service](https://docs.openstack.org/keystone/newton/)
* [Image service](https://docs.openstack.org/glance/newton/)

   The links above may take you to documentation for the latest OpenStack release of each project.  This may not be the same as the version we're running at UKFast.

## API references

To identify the current API version your eCloud Flex solution is based upon, login to your [eCloud Flex dashboard](https://api.openstack.ecloud.co.uk/project/api_access/) and head to API Access in the left hand menu.  You'll see a list of service endpoints which will help identify the correct version in use, and hence which documentation you should refer to.

* [Compute API](https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/compute/)
* [Object Storage API](https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/object-storage/)
* [Block Storage API](https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/block-storage/v3/index.html)
* [Networking APIs](https://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/networking/) (includes load balancing, firewalls, security groups and more)
