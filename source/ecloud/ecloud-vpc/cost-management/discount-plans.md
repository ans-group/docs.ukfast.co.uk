# Discount Plans
Discount Plans are designed to reduce your spend for committing to a 12,24 or 36 month term for your eCloud VPC resources. These discount plans are applied across all of your VPC spending and are not tied to any specific resources, thus not locking you in to specific items if you needed to upgrade, downgrade or try to sell a resource.

### Create
To add a discount plan, you need to know the estimated amount of pay-and-go spend of your environment(s), to do this you can use the calculator or if you are already using eCloud VPC then you can see your estimations from the spend summary page, keep in mind though that may only show partial months.

Set your commitment minimum spend (this is the pay-as-you-go amount you are estimating), the minimum term and when you would like the plan to start.

The form then shows you what you can use (your PAYG amount) before additional charges will be incurred and the amount that you will pay for your PAYG amount.

It is possible to have as many Discount Plans as you need.

Example 1:
You estimate your PAYG spend to be £13,500 a month and you wish to commit to a 36 month term to benefit from the maximum discount which works out at a spend of £10,800.

At the end of the first month you are using £15,625 of eCloud VPC resources.
£13,500 of the above £15,625 is charged at £10,800 and then you are charged the standard PAYG rate for everything above £13,500 which is £2,125. Your total bill is therefore £10,800 + £2,125 = £12,925

Example 2:
You estimate your PAYG spend to be £13,500 a month and you wish to commit to a 36 month term to benefit from the maximum discount which works out at a spend of £10,800.

At the end of the first month you are using £13,000 of eCloud VPC resources.
Your PAYG spend is not therefore above the £13,500 so there would be no additional costs above the £10,800.
