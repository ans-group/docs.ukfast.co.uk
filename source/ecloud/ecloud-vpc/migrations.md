.. tip::
  A successful migration can be ensured with the following three steps

  * **Capacity Planning** - Is your new solution suitable for your expected workload? Load testing is a must before going live.
  * **Backups** - Ensure you have a rollback option
  * **Testing** - Have a development pipeline to ensure you obtain the expected outcome, and test before changing DNS
  * **Maintenance**- Disable monitoring during your work, and put your website into maintenance
```
