# Getting started with Live Optics (formerly DPACK)

You can request a Live Optics (formerly DPACK) capture by contacting your UKFast Account Manager or raising a support ticket through [MyUKFast](https://portal.ans.co.uk/pss/add.php)

Running a Live Optics capture will allow you and UKFast to measure a wide variety of metrics such as:

* CPU & RAM Usage
* IOPS
* IO Size
* Disk Latency & Throughput
* Queue Depth
* Network Throughout
* Hard Page Faults per Second.

A Live Optics can be run on any [Windows](/monitoring/dpack/windows) or [Linux](/monitoring/dpack/linux) based operating system.
