# Getting started with DPACK

You can request a DPACK capture by contacting your UKFast Account Manager or raising a support ticket through [MyUKFast](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/pss/add.php)

Running a DPACK will allow you and UKFast to measure a wide variety of metrics such as:

* CPU & RAM Usage
* IOPS
* IO Size
* Disk Latency & Throughput
* Queue Depth
* Network Throughout
* Hard Page Faults per Second.

A DPACK can be run on any [Windows](/windows.md) or [Linux](/linux.md) based operating system.
