## Running a standard Live Optics:

**This section explains how to run a standard Live Optics which allows a collection of up to 7 Days.**

**LiveOptics was previously named DPACK, it has since changed and has now become LiveOptics**

1) First create a folder and put the LiveOpticsDotNet4_5.exe in as it will create quite a few files when first started:

2) Select "Server & Virtualization" and then click on the "Optical Prime" window to the next pop-up to allow the Live Optics program to start:

3) UKFast suggests you keep the Live Optics Data Options to "Establish a secure (HTTPS) Connection to the Live Optics Web Service" as the server metrics are streamed to our Live Optics portal at UKFast and allows for easier analysis:

4) You should now be presented with the main Live Optics Collection Screen:

5) If you are going to take a collection of the local machine, please select the "Add Local System" button on the portal:

6) If you are going to take a collection of a remote machine, please select the "Add Remote System" button on the portal, you will then be shown the screen below which will allow you to remotely take a collection by supplying the IP, Username and Password of the remote server.
