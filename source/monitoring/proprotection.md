# PROprotection report

A PROprotection report gives a consolidated view of various usage and performance metrics related to your UKFast-hosted servers.

Follow these steps to run a PROprotection report:

1. Login to [MyUKFast](https://my.ukfast.co.uk) and go to `Dedicated Servers` in the `Products and Services` menu.
2. Go to the section called `Reports`.
3. Click the `Generate` button next to the PROprotection option
4. Complete the details requested, including filename, metrics and information to be included, and report time frame.
5. Choose the people from your account contacts list who you want to be emailed when the PROprotection report is available.
6. Click `Generate Report`.  The report may take a little while to generate, depending on how many servers you have in your account.  You will receive an email when your report is ready to view and download as a `.pdf`
