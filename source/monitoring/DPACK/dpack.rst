Using DPACK to monitor server/VM performance
============================================

The Dell Performance Analysis Collection Kit (DPACK) is free software provided by Dell to check performance of a server/VM for a set period of time. It is totally non-intrusive so can be run on production environments at any time.

You can request a DPACK capture by contacting your UKFast Account Manager or raising a support ticket through [MyUKFast](https://my.ukfast.co.uk)

Running a DPACK will allow you and UKFast to measure a wide variety of metrics such as:

* CPU & RAM Usage
* IOPS
* IO Size
* Disk Latency & Throughput
* Queue Depth
* Network Throughout
* Hard Page Faults per Second.

A DPACK can be run on any [Windows](dpack/windows.md) or [Linux](dpack/linux.md) based operating system.
