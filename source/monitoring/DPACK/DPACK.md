# Using DPACK to monitor server/VM performance

The Dell Performance Analysis Collection Kit is free software provided by Dell to check performance of a server/VM for a set period of time.

You can request a DPACK capture by contacting your Account Manager.

Running a DPACK will allow you and UKFast to measure a wide variety of metrics such as:

* CPU & RAM Usage
* IOPS
* IO Size
* Disk Latency & Throughput
* Queue Depth
* Network Throughout
* Hard Page Faults per Second.

A DPACK can be run on any [Windows](Windows.md) or [Linux](Linux.md) based operating system.
