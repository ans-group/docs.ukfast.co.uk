# Install New Relic

In this article we will discuss how to install the New Relic PHP agent on a CentOS Server. New Relic is a third party developer tool that can provide indepth application monitoring which can be used to identify problem areas in the application, commonly performance related.

New Relic offers a [free tier account](https://newrelic.com/signup/) with "100 GB/month of free data ingest" for users to take advantage of that doesn't require using credit card info.

## Prerequsites 

- License key 
  - In order to install New Relic, you will need an **APM** [license key.](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/install-new-relic/account-setup/license-key) 
- PHP compatibility 
  - New Relic supports popular frameworks and most new versions of PHP 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4.
  - More information on the supported frameworks can be found in the [New Relic documentation](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/agents/php-agent/getting-started/php-agent-compatibility-requirements).

## Install the agent

1. Sign into your New Relic account, go to **Account Settings** and take a copy of your **APM licence key**.

2. Log into the server using SSH and run the following command to tell the package manager about the New Relic repository:

```bash
 $ rpm -Uvh http://yum.newrelic.com/pub/newrelic/el5/x86_64/newrelic-repo-5-3.noarch.rpm
```

3. Install the New Relic `Agent` and `Daemon` using the below command:

```bash
 $ yum install newrelic-php5
 ```

 4. Run the following command to begin in the install:

 ```bash
 $ newrelic-install install
 ```

This is where you will need the **APM license Key** and the installer will first ask you for it:

```bash
New Relic PHP Agent Installation (interactive mode)
===================================================

   Enter New Relic license key (or leave blank):
```

5. Restart the webserver.

- For `Apache` servers:
```bash
 $ service httpd restart
```
- For `Nginx` servers:
```bash
$ service nginx restart
```
- For `php-fpm` servers:
```bash
$ service php-fpm restart
```

Now once New Relic has captured enough traffic, log back into your New Relic account and data should appear in the APM tab.

## Troubleshooting

If no data appears after 5 minutes make sure that you are generating some traffic to the website. New Relic will only display data it captures, if no traffic is hitting the website its possible the website may not hace had any visitors yet. 

If data is still not being produced after generating traffic to the website try the [Diagnostics tool](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/using-new-relic/cross-product-functions/troubleshooting/new-relic-diagnostics) built by New Relic to identify issues.

To ensure the New Relic agent has been installed correctly, create a phpinfo() page in the websites document root.

For example:

```bash
 $ vi /var/www/vhosts/example.com/public_html/info.php
```
```bash
<?php phpinfo(); ?>
```
Now browse to example.com/info.php, if New Relic is installed correctly, you will see a section on New Relic.

Check that there is a valid license.

If the license shows as `***INVALID***`, run the `newrelic-install install` again and ensure that license key is valid and correct.
