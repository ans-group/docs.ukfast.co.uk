# Recover Lost or Deleted Email
If you suspect an email has been accidentally deleted, don't worry there are a few safety features built into your email client and on the Hosted Exchange servers.

 1 First check the deleted items in Outlook
 2 Use the search tab in Outlook to search "All Outlook Items"
 3 The Exchange server has a 7 day retention. Click [Recover Deleted Items](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Recover-deleted-items-in-Outlook-2010-cd9dfe12-8e8c-4a21-bbbf-4bd103a3f1fe#BKMK_recoverableitems) to find out more from Microsoft Office
 4 It's possible a rule has moved the email into a folder within the account, login to the web based version of the account at [UKFast Shared Exchange Client Login](https://client.ukfastexchange.co.uk).
