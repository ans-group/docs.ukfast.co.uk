# Recover Lost or Deleted Email

If you suspect an email has been accidentally deleted, don't worry there are a few safety features built into your email client and on the Hosted Exchange servers.

1. First check the deleted items in Outlook
2. Use the search tab in Outlook to search "All Outlook Items"
3. The Exchange server has a 7 day retention. Click [Recover Deleted Items](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/recover-deleted-items-in-outlook-for-windows-49e81f3c-c8f4-4426-a0b9-c0fd751d48ce) to find out more from Microsoft Office
4. It's possible a rule has moved the email into a folder within the account, login to the web based version of the account at [UKFast Shared Exchange Client Login](https://client.ukfastexchange.co.uk).
