# Connecting via Webmail

The Outlook Web Access (OWA) page for our shared exchange infrastructure can be found here:

Using the webmail client can be a great diagnostic tool. If you're having trouble connecting in one of the other ways, we'll often ask you to first log in over webmail to see if it's a simple credentials issue.
