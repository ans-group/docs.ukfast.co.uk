6. ### Set Up Email Accounts

    1. Enter Your Email Address: In the Add Account wizard, enter your email address associated with your Microsoft Exchange account in the "Email Address" field.

    2. Provide Your Password: Enter the password for your Microsoft Exchange email account in the "Password" field.

    3. Automatic Configuration: Outlook will attempt to automatically configure your Exchange email account settings based on your email address and password. If successful, you'll see a green check-mark, indicating that the account setup is complete.

    4. If the automatic setup doesn't work, proceed to step 7, if it is successful, go to step 8.


7. ### Manual Configuration

If Outlook couldn't automatically configure your Exchange account, you'll need to set it up manually.

    1. Select the option "Manual setup or additional server types" and click "Next".

    2. Choose Account Type: On the next screen, select the option "Microsoft Exchange or compatible service" and click "Next".

    3. Enter Exchange Server Settings: In the Microsoft Exchange Settings section add **client.ukfastexchange.co.uk**

    4. User Name: Enter your user name or email address associated with your Exchange account.

    5. Use Cached Exchange Mode (Optional): If you want to store a local copy of your mailbox for offline access, check the box for "Use Cached Exchange Mode." This option is recommended for most users.

    6. Check Name: Click on the "Check Name" button to validate your server and user information. If everything is entered correctly, Outlook will resolve your name and underline it.


8. ### Complete the Setup

Click "Next" and then "Finish" to complete the setup process. Outlook will finalise the configuration and connect to your Microsoft Exchange email account.

You have successfully added a new Microsoft Exchange email account to Microsoft Outlook. The account will now be listed in the Account Settings window, and you'll be able to access your Exchange mailbox and manage your emails, calendar, and contacts within Outlook.
