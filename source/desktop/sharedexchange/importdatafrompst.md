In the Import Outlook Data File window, you have several options for importing the data. Here are the most common ones:
    1. Import items into the current folder: This option will import the data directly into your existing folders in Outlook.
    2. Import items into the same folder in: Choose this option if you want to create a separate folder to import the data into. Click the "Browse" button to select the destination folder.
    3. Replace duplicates with items imported: If you have duplicate items between the .pst file and your Outlook account, selecting this option will replace the existing items with the imported ones.
    4. Do not import duplicates: This option skips importing any items that already exist in your Outlook account.
    5. Select the desired import options and click "Next."


7. ### Choose import target

On the final screen, choose the option "Import items into the current folder" or "Import items into the same folder in" (depending on your selection in step 6). You can also check the box next to "Include subfolders" if you want to import data from subfolders within the .pst file.


8. ### Finishing Up

Click "Finish" to start the import process. Outlook will begin importing the data from the .pst file into your account.

Monitor Import Progress: Depending on the size of the .pst file and the amount of data being imported, the process may take some time. You can monitor the progress in the Outlook status bar. Once the import is complete, you'll see a notification indicating that the process finished successfully. Click "OK" to close the notification.

Congratulations! You have successfully imported data from a .pst file into Outlook. The imported items should now be available in your Outlook account.
