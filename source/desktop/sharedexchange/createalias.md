# Create an Alias

 When logged into [MyUKFast](https://www.ukfast.co.uk/myukfast.html?msg=6&url=%2Fdashboard.php), in the products and services    menu (top, center of the screen), select `Shared Exchange`.


 You will then be presented with a list of domains which you have purchased shared exchange mailboxes for. Select the relevant domain.


 When you have clicked on your domain, you will be presented with a list of email addresses that you have associated with the domains that are hosted with UKFast. You now need to select the relevant email address you want to create the alias for.


 You are then directed to the alias configuration page where you can make a number of changes. In the bottom section of the screen, you can find the list of Aliases you have created. You can create unlimited aliases free of charge.


 The final step is to click on ‘Add Alias' and type in the alias you would like to be associated with this email address.

 *Please note you cannot send as an alias*
