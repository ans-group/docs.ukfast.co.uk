```eval_rst
.. warning::
   As always, strong passwords are highly recommended for your own security.

   Mailboxes are frequently targetted by blind, brute-force attacks, so any dictionary words or common substitions (`m1ch43L!`) should be avoided.

   Whilst it may be slightly harder to remember, choosing a password that is `at least 8 characters long and a mixture of upper/lower case letters and numbers` will keep you safer in the long run.
```

If you have any issues carrying out the above steps, please raise a ticket with UKFast requesting a password change and our engineers will be able to assist.
