On the shared exchange platform, email forwarders are configured using the webmail client.

As such, you'll first need to log into the webmail area, as described in the following article: [Connecting via Webmail](/desktop/sharedexchange/webmailconnect) via this link <https://client.ukfastexchange.co.uk/owa>

In the top right hand corner, select `Settings` and then `Options`
