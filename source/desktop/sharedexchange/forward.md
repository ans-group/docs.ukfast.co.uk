On the shared exchange platform, email forwarders are configured using the webmail client.

As such, you'll first need to log into the webmail area, as described in the following article: [Connecting via Webmail](/desktop/sharedexchange/webmailconnect.html) via this link <https://client.ukfastexchange.co.uk/owa>

In the top right hand corner, select `Settings` and then `Options`

Select the plus icon and then `Create a new rule for arriving messages..`

Give the new rule a name under the heading `*When the message arrives, and:` select `[Apply to all messages]`
