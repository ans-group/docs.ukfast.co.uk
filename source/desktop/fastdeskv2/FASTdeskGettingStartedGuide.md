# FASTdesk Getting Start Guide

FASTdesk®  is UKFast’s Desktop as a Service (DaaS) solution, which allows users and organisations to work more effectively and securely by giving access to files, applications and desktop items remotely via an internet connection. All desktop settings and files are stored remotely in the cloud, providing cross-device compatibility and eliminating the risk of data loss by removing the risk of unauthorised access. This DaaS solution allows users to work in the same way they would with a traditional local desktop, but increase the flexibility with which they do so.
