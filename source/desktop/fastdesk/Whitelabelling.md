# White Labelling

White Labelling allows you to impress your clients with out-of-the-box, enterprise-level technology, branded from your own portfolio. Offer UKFast's Desktop-as-a-Service solution as your own, build your brand and expand your business offerings. White Labelling will enable you to customise your FastDesk environment without the cost of a Private FastDesk. You will be able to add your own branding to custom domain.

## Getting Prepared

In order to incorporate any form of white labelling onto your FastDesk environment, you will first need to purchase a domain. This domain can be anything of your choosing. This often relates to the company using the FastDesk environment. 

```eval_rst
.. note::

  You can purchase the domain from any reputable domain seller, please note that you will need access to control the DNS zone for the domain.
   
```

Once the domain has been purchased, you will also need to buy an SSL for your new domain to ensure that that your FastDesk environment is secure. You can purchase SSLs from UKFast within your [MyUKFast Control Panel](https://my.ukfast.co.uk/login) (https://my.ukfast.co.uk/login). Once logged in, you can use the navigation menu to find SSL certificates. From here, you can buy a certificate. Once the SSL has been validated, the FastDesk team will handle the rest of the process in regards to making the environment secure. 

Next, you need to configure the DNS for the domain. You can do this from your DNS zone which is where you purchased the domain. We will provide you with the IP Address to point the domain too. You will need to create an A record for this.

## The Design

To customise the environment you will need to send us the image you would like displayed as the portal background, how you would like to customise other elements of the login page, the message and number users can call if they require support and what URL you will want to utilise. Everything here will be present on the home page of your FastDesk environment where you will log in each time.


```eval_rst
.. warning::

  The FastDesk team could ask you to resize the image to fit the required dimensions.
   
```
