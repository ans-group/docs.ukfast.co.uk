# FASTdesk Getting Start Guide

FASTdesk®  is UKFast’s Desktop as a Service (DaaS) solution, which allows users and organisations to work more effectively and securely by giving access to files, applications and desktop items remotely via an internet connection. All desktop settings and files are stored remotely in the cloud, providing cross-device compatibility and eliminating the risk of data loss by removing the risk of unauthorised access. This DaaS solution allows users to work in the same way they would with a traditional local desktop, but increase the flexibility with which they do so regardless of the endpoint device hardware, operating system or form factor.

This guide provides step by step instructions on installing and accessing FASTdesk on your Windows PC device. Day-to-day, there are two available methods to access FASTdesk on your Windows PC. These methods consist of the Citrix Workspace application as well as the web portal (FASTdesk URL). Whilst this guide will help you install the Citrix Workspace Application in order to access FASTdesk for the first time, we highly recommend using the web portal to access FASTdesk on a day-to-day basis. Both the Citrix Workspace application and web portal gives you instant access to your FASTdesk environment in an easy-to-use, all-in-one interface. They are also fully integrated with the Citrix Content Collaboration (Also known as ShareFile) which gives you ability to upload and download files all in one place. You can use the web portal on domain and non-domain joined PCs and thin clients. For a list of known compatible thin clients please refer to the FASTdesk technical specification or contact the FASTdesk support team.   

If you currently use the older Citrix Receiver for Android, Citrix Workspace will replace this. The Citrix Workspace app for Android supports Nougat (Android 7.x), Oreo (Android 8.x) and Pie (Android 9.x). For the most optimum experience, we recommend updating your Android device to the latest Android Software. If your Android device has insufficient storage, it is possible to install the Citrix Workspace App for Android on an external SD card and mount it on the local device (For more information on this, please contact the FASTdesk Team).

# Step 1 - Installation

From your device, download and install the latest version of the Citrix Workspace app at this URL:
https://www.citrix.co.uk/downloads/workspace-app/

As you can see from the image below, all versions of Workspace are listed. Expand the section relative to your operating system and install the app.

Mobile versions of the app can be accessed via the above link or preferably, through your devices' app store (e.g. Apple’s
App Store or Google Play Store for Android) - Note - Citrix Workspace for iOS is only available through the Apple App Store. Choosing Citrix Workspace for iOS from the above link will direct users to the Apple App Store anyway.

# Step 2 - Logging in

From your preferred browser, log in via the URL: https://www.fastdesk.co.uk using the username and password provided.

After you have successfully logged in for the first time, you will be asked to change your password. Your password must be a minimum of 8 characters in length and contain at least 3 of the following: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols and unicode characters that are deemed as alphabetic characters but not uppercase or lowercase. Your password can also not contain the name of your account. For example, if your account name is John Smith, a password with the word 'john' will not be accepted. 

# Step 3 - Workspace App setup (Optional)

If you prefer to login directly to the Citrix Workspace app, you can do so. After launching Citrix Workspace for the first time, you will be asked to add an account. Simply type the following URL "https://www.fastdesk.co.uk" and click __Add__. You will then be asked to provide your username and password.

If you're setting up the Workspace App on Android or iOS, you will similarly be asked to enter your company email address or Store URL. Again, enter "https://www.fastdesk.co.uk"

# Step 4 - Launching a desktop

Once you have logged into FASTdesk®, you will be presented with all of your Applications and Hosted Desktops. You can navigate between Desktops and Apps via the icons found at the top of the screen. Simply click __Desktops__ to navigate to this category. You can also click the Details link for additional options. As well as being able to open your desktop you can also choose to Add To Favourites,which pins your desktop to the Favourites category
