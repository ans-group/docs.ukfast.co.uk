FASTdesk Getting Start Guide: Android

FASTdesk® is UKFast’s Desktop as a Service (DaaS) solution, which allows users and organisations to work more effectively and securely by giving access to files, applications, and desktop items remotely via an internet connection. All desktop settings and files are stored remotely in the cloud, providing cross-device compatibility and eliminating the risk of data loss by removing the risk of unauthorised access. This DaaS solution allows users to work in the same way they would with a traditional local desktop, but increase the flexibility with which they do so regardless of the endpoint device hardware, operating system or form factor.

Pre-Installation information

This guide provides step by step instructions on installing and accessing FASTdesk on your Android device through the Citrix Workspace application. It is possible to access FASTdesk through the web portal on your Android device, however, it is recommended FASTdesk is accessed specifically through the Citrix Workspace Application. The Citrix Workspace application gives you instant access to your FASTdesk environment in an easy-to-use, all-in-one interface. The Workspace application also fully integrated with the Citrix Content Collaboration (Also known as ShareFile) which gives you ability to upload and download files all within the one application. If you currently use the older Citrix Receiver for Android, Citrix Workspace will replace this. The Citrix Workspace app for Android supports Nougat (Android 7.x), Oreo (Android 8.x) and Pie (Android 9.x). For the most optimum experience, we recommend updating your Android device to the latest Android Software. If your Android device has insufficient storage, it is possible to install the Citrix Workspace App for Android on an external SD card and mount it on the local device (For more information on this, please contact the FASTdesk Team).
 
Step 1 - Installation
To begin with, on your Android device, navigate to and open the Google Play store. Once complete, use the application search bar to look for “Citrix Workspace”. When found, please refer to the image included to ensure it is the correct application. Once confirmed, proceed to install the application by tapping the green install button.

"You will then be prompted to enter your username and password into the application. Go ahead and enter the username and password credentials that were provided to you by the FASTdesk team.

Once successfully logged in for the first time, you will be asked to change your password. Your password must be a minimum of 8 characters in length and contain at least 3 of the following: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols and special characters e.g “! ” £”. Your password can also not contain the name of your account. For example, if your account name is John Smith, a password with the word ‘john’ will not be accepted.

Step 3 - Launching a desktop
When you first log in, you will notice there is nothing to click except the menu button in the left top corner of the screen and the search button in the top right corner of the screen(refer to the image included). Select the menu button and there is a list of options (Home, Apps, and Desktops). The "Home" section in the menu contains hosted desktops you have tagged as your favourites whilst the "Apps" section presents you with specific applications that have been made available to you. In most cases, you will not use this section. The "Refresh" options will reset your connection to the application whilst the "Settings" section presents you with the settings you can customise including the ability for you to manage your accounts.
