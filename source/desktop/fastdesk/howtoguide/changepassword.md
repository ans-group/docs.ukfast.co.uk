# How to change your FastDesk Password

You have the ability to change your own FastDesk password if you are not already locked out of your account. If you are already locked out then please contact our support team either by sending an email to support@ukfast.co.uk or by calling 0800 923 0617. If you are not locked out, you can change your password either through the web portal or via the Citrix Workspace Application.

## Change your FastDesk Password through the Web Portal

From your local PC, browse via an internet browser to the FastDesk web portal [link here](https://www.fastdesk.co.uk). Once here, you will see **Image 1** as shown below. Please log in with your FastDesk username and password.

```eval_rst
.. warning::

   Your new password must be a minimum of 8 characters in length and contain at least 3 of the following: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols and special characters e.g `"! " Â£"`. Your password can also not contain the name of your account. For example, if your account name is John Smith, a password with the word `'john'`will not be accepted.

```
Once your password has been changed, it should simply log you in. It may ask you to detect receiver, if so, simply select the option that allows it to detect the receiver.
