## Telephone Support

When you make a call to FastDesk telephone number, you will join an orderly queue for telephone support. You will hear an announcement of your position in the queue along with an estimated wait time for an engineer.

At any point whilst waiting, you may press 1 to submit a call back request. If this option is selected, one of our engineers will return your call as soon as they become free and you will not lose your place in the queue.

If we unable to connect your call after five minutes, you will hear an official announcement with the option to leave a message and request a call back. Again, if this option is selected, you will not lose your place in the queue.

For any users that may require telephone support please ensure that they are listed as a contact within your MyUKFast account. They must have access to telephone support and have already set up their telephone security password as our engineers can only discuss your account with an authorised user.

## Service Desk workflow

Once a ticket is submitted (or call is made), a 1st line engineer will review the issue at hand. If they need to speak to the affected user(s), they will call the user or schedule this in.

On a call, the engineer will perform basic troubleshooting and collect all the relevant information. If the problem cannot be fixed on the phone call, the engineer will go away and investigate this further using all the information they collected. If progress is not made, they will converse with other engineers in their tier before escalating up to second line.

2nd Line engineers will review the ticket and the information provided by both the client and the internal ticket notes and begin to investigate the issue. As above, the 2nd line team can escalate to the 3rd line team and the 3rd line team can escalate to the FastDesk Infrastructure Team.

## Out of Hours Support

If the FastDesk environment was unavailable for 1 user and it was outside of support hours, we would recommend you raise a ticket with a high priority (P2). If it was unavailable for the entire user base, then we would recommend you raise a ticket with critical priority (P1).

In each case, the ticket will be picked up by UKFast windows or Linux engineers and would be responded to. If an engineer spots infrastructure failure, the internal on call process will be activated in order to restore access to infrastructure.

## Incident Management

In the event of an Incident, it is important that the correct processes are followed. If there a P1 issue, please initially call the support line. Next, raise the issue to your AM/SM. This ticket would be raised as `"Critical"`. Please remember to check our [Network Status page](https://ukfast.network/) to ensure your issue has not already been identified as a major incident. If your issue appears on our status page, please ensure you have logged a ticket.

For P2 issues, please raise a ticket initially and call the support line to check on ticket or to submit more information. This ticket would be raised as `"High"`.  For P3 issues, please raise a ticket. This ticket would be classed as `"Normal"`. Applications installs, general queries, etc. would come under this category.

 ## Application Support

UKFast are not responsible for the migration of third-party applications and whilst help and assistance can be provided throughout this process, the application migration should be managed by third parties where possible.

As stated on the Pre-Launch Questionnaire, a FastDesk desktop is natively equipped with Google Chrome, Citrix Files for Windows and Adobe Reader (Free Version). The 0365 suite will also be preinstalled along with the Launch Build (If applicable).

In the case of well-known applications used by the majority of our customers, UKFast can at their discretion assist the customer in facilitating the installation of the applications. The onus is upon the customer to ensure their applications are updated. UKFast can assist in updating applications on a best effort basis.

If there is an issue in the installation of a third-party application, UKFast will troubleshoot the problem to the extent to which we can rule out the Citrix environment as the source of the problem. If this is the case, the engineers will recommend that you raise a support case with the application developers due to their expertise with the application. UKFast will be cooperative in helping the third-party software developers with what they need to troubleshoot. The Customer is responsible for accepting advice and any consequences for any unsupported applications.
