## Step 1 - Uninstalling the Citrix Workspace Application

To do this, ensure you are **outside** of your FastDesk session. In the bottom left corner of your deskop, click the Windows icon and type `Control Panel` in the search bar. This will bring up the search bar and you will see `Control Panel` appear as a search result. Click this to open *Control Panel*.  Please refer to **image** below for a visual representation.

```eval_rst
.. note::

   Your new password must be a minimum of 8 characters in length and contain at least 3 of the following: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, symbols and special characters e.g “! ” £”. Your password can also not contain the name of your account. For example, if your account name is John Smith, a password with the word ‘john’ will not be accepted. Once your password has been reset, it should simply log you in. It may ask you to dectect receiver, if so, simply select the option that allows it to detect the receiver.
   
```

```eval_rst
.. warning::

   Whenever you log out of a desktop, do allow at least 3 minutes before attempting to log back in. This is to ensure the session correctly ends before another one is open. If you have not waited long enough, there is a danger of your applications not appearing when you log in. If you do find that this is the case, simply log out, wait at least 3 minutes and log back in again.
