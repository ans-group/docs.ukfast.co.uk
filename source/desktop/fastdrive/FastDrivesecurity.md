# FastDrive Security

The FastDrive solution is only ever housed in our government and ISO-certified, ultra-secure data centres managed by security cleared personnel. By design, all user files used inside are stored inside FastDrive meaning unauthorised access to data through the loss of a user device is no longer an issue. The data centre secured up to UK government IL4 standards, which ensures your solution is always protected by exceptional levels of both physical and virtual security.

The data centres are based in Manchester, GB. Physically, the perimeter of the Data Centre is secured by 2.8m prison grade fencing. 24hr CCTV is in place in all data centres and this is monitored via a live link in the guardhouse. Alongside this, they are staffed 24/7/365 by security accredited UKFast Staff. To prevent entry into the facility a man trap, accompanied by a ram proof barrier is in place; visitors have to drive into the space between the two gates, provide their access code, name and the company they work for at the gate. Access to the data centre is restricted to data centre employees only. On the website, it is also possible to take a virtual tour to give you a better visual idea.

The FastDrive service sits on enterprise grade technology. This means UKFast can guarantee 100% power and connectivity to the FastDrive solution. Every element of the UKFast infrastructure used to host the FastDrive service is designed to N+1 standard. This includes the:

* Cisco ASA Firewalls which are locked down to Citrix SaaS Application Tier
* UKFast Load Balancers
* Cisco UCS Blades
* Enterprise HP3PAR SAN Storage
* Citrix StorageZone Controllers
* eCloud Vault Storage used to store Customer Data

Inside FastDrive, data is encrypted both in transit and at rest. In transit, customer files are protected between the web application and the UKFast on premise storage location using TLS with using 256-bit encryption. At rest, UKFast use AES 256-bit encryption, a Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) encryption algorithm.

FastDrive uses file versioning alongside a 45-day retention policy as opposed to a backup.  This means if a customer deletes a file, each customer has the ability through their own customer portal to restore these files. However, any data outside of 45 days is not kept. This file versioning functionality is built into the same infrastructure that the main FastDrive Solution sits on.

We have a number of accreditations highlighting our commitment towards keeping data safe. These include but are not restricted to; ISO 27001:2013 Info Security Management, ISO 9001:2008 Quality, ISO 22301 and PCI DSS compliance. You can find the full list of certifications here You can find these [Here](https://www.ukfast.co.uk/certifications.html) or alternatively visit: `https://www.ukfast.co.uk/certifications.html`
