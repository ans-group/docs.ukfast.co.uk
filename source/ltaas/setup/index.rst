Setup
=================================

The first steps you'll take are not within MyUKFast. You should take some time to talk with relevant parties
about the risks involved (But also the benefits!)

Once you've done that, you'll be able to move on to setting up the domain and from there you should notify
relevant parties about when you're going to be performing tests.
