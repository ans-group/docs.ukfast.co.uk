# Notify Relevant Parties

It's important that you let every who needs to know you're running a test know.
As described earlier and as you'll agree in the terms when creating a test, you'll
be performing a test which has potential to cause damage when not done carefully.

Since there's risk involved (depending on how and when you use the product), you should
let individuals in you organisation know that the test is being performed. This
will let your organisation perform pre-requisite tasks you may have, such as
a risk assessment, but it will also mean that potential users of a site or application
are aware there may be downtime at the scheduled test time. This saves your
support team and our support team from calls regarding known outages, should an
outage be caused by the test.
