### What is Threat Monitoring

Threat Monitoring from UKFast is our tailored, all in one HIDS/SIEM system that enables you to continually monitor for malicious activity on your IT environment. Threat Monitoring is a must for businesses who take security seriously and is highly recommended to those who wish to achieve PCI-DSS compliance for processing online card payments.

### How does Threat Monitoring link into PCI-DSS?

As per control 12.4.1 of the PCI-DSS standards, businesses that accept card payments are required to employ a form log collection to allow activity to be tracked in the event of a breach.

UKFast's Threat Monitoring handles this for you. By collecting all your server's logs and sending them to our Threat Monitoring infrastructure, we can parse these logs for threats and store them securely for 12 months, as required the PCI-DSS requirements.

This easy, no-fuss solution to this, and many other PCI-DSS requirements ensure your business is compliant and ready to take card payments online.
