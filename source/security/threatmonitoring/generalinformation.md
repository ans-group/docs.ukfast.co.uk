# General Information

Threat Monitoring from UKFast enables you to continually monitor for malicious attempts to access your IT environment. Threat Monitoring is a must for businesses who take security seriously, and is highly recommended to those who wish to achieve PCI-DSS compliance for processing online card payments.

## What is Threat Monitoring?

Threat Monitoring works by installing an agent on to your server(s), which continuously monitors for potential threats. It involves continuously analysing data to distinguish between potential security breaches and normal activity.

## What is Threat Response?

Threat Response is an additional managed service, available alongside Threat Monitoring, where the UKFast Security team will proactively monitor and respond to alerts generated by your Threat Monitoring agents.
