=====================================
File Monitoring (FIM)
=====================================

File Integrity Monitoring is a great tool to track when important files are removed, changed, or when files are added to a vulnerable location. Threat Monitoring can be configured to monitor custom files and directories to provide alerts via MyUKFast for use during an investigation.

By default, all servers are configured with our default File Integrity Monitoring configuration, which includes the monitoring of system-critical files such as configuration and password files.
