Malware
=====================================

Malware and viruses pose a huge threat to do enterprise systems. Cryptojacking is becoming more and more common, along with CryptoCurrency Miners, Backdoors and Trojans, defending against malware has never been so important.

UKFast Threat Monitoring can closely interface with Industry-leading Antivirus Platforms, such as McAfee AV. Threat Monitoring can be configured to trigger an alert when McAfee detects malware and report of the action taken.

Threat Monitoring can also detect many common Linux rootkits. By using our rootkit detection module and interfacing closely with open source tools such as 'rkhunter', many rootkits can be detected and handled quickly and effectively.
