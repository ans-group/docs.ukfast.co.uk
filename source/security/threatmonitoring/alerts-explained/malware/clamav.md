## ClamAV


### ClamAV Virus detected multiple times

*What does this rule mean?*


Potentially indicating an outbreak, this rule is triggered when multiple anti-virus warning messages are triggered. This could mean that multiple malware has been discovered, and further action may be needed. It's common to see other rules trigger in addition to this that may elaborate on the nature of the malware. Nevertheless, we always recommend manually checking your anti-virus logs and status for information, and acting accordingly.

Many attackers follow an attack with malware. Installing a trojan, backdoor or, rootkit or RAT on your server is high on an attackers priority list. Should they be discovered, and the exploits patched, this malware could allow the attacker to regain access to your server, potentially bypassing authentication and auditing techniques.

Outbreaks are common with more difficult malware. They'll often replicate themselves, creating different signatures and changing their code in the progress in an attempt to become undetectable. This is called polymorphic malware and it's incredibly difficult to discover and remove.

*What triggers this rule?*


One of the most common triggers for this rule is unwanted software that is installed along with third-party applications, such as Tool Bars to viruses like the infamous PCOptimiserPro Trojan. This rule can also trigger when legitimate software is triggered. This can happen when the operating system doesn't recognise an application.

Additionally, malware may have infected the system from other sources, like succeeding an attack, through a malicious email or suspicious file. After the initial malware event has been dealt with, the Threat Monitoring team is on hand to provide support when investigating further into the origins of malware.

*What action do I need to take?*


As a first responder, you should log into the server in question to determine whether the file in question was deleted by the anti-virus software. If it was successfully removed, we recommend manually running a system scan to check for any remnants of the malware. Should the malware be present on the system still, it should be removed, either through the anti-virus programs quarantine features or manually? Once this has been done another system scan should be run.

For good measure, we also recommend running a fresh Clam AV scan.

First, you have to update the virus definitions with:

    `sudo freshclam`

Then you can scan for viruses.

    `clamscan OPTIONS File/Folder`

If necessary start with root permissions: sudo clamscan.

Examples:

To check all files on the computer, displaying the name of each file:

    `clamscan -r /`

To check all files on the computer, but only display infected files and ring a bell when finding:

    `clamscan -r --bell -i /`

To scan all files on the computer but only display infected files when found and have this run in the background:

    `clamscan -r -i / &`

Note - Display background process status by running the jobs command.

To check files in the all users home directories:

    `clamscan -r /home`

To check files in the USER home directory and move infected files to another folder:

    `clamscan -r --move/home/USER/VIRUS /home/USER`

To check files in the USER home directory and remove infected files (WARNING: Files are gone.):

    `clamscan -r --remove /home/USER`

To see more options:

    `clamscan --help`

## Clamd Error

*What does this mean?*


As an informational rule, this will trigger when the ClamAV service hits an error. Pending further investigation, this error could mean that the ClamAV watchdog/service has crashed or that a scan has failed before it could complete.

Unfortunately, ClamAV does not pass much information as the root cause of the error in its log file to Threat Monitoring. In response to this rule, a quick investigation into the cause of the issue is recommended and any remediation to pick the service up again would be advisable.

*How can I fix this?*


We recommend looking directly at the raw ClamAV log, they may share some more verbose information that could indicate why the service hot an error state.

The claim service can be restarted easily with:


`service clamd restart`


or on a cpanel installation:


`/scripts/restartsrv_clamd`


For good measure, we also recommend running a fresh Clam AV scan.

First, you have to update the virus definitions with:

`sudo freshclam`

Then you can scan for viruses.

`clamscan OPTIONS File/Folder `


If necessary start with root permissions: sudo clamscan.

Examples:

To check all files on the computer, displaying the name of each file:

`clamscan -r /`

To check all files on the computer, but only display infected files and ring a bell when finding:

`clamscan -r --bell -i /`

`clamscan -r -i / &`

Note - Display background process status by running the jobs command.

To check files in the all users home directories:

`clamscan -r /home`

To check files in the USER home directory and move infected files to another folder:

`clamscan -r --move/home/USER/VIRUS /home/USER`

To check files in the USER home directory and remove infected files (WARNING: Files are gone.):

`clamscan -r --remove /home/USER`
