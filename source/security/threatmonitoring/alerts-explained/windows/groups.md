## Windows Groups

*What are windows groups?*

Windows groups are a way to provide permissions to multiple users or computers at once. Microsoft recommends that all permissions should be applied to groups and then the users are added to the groups to get the permissions that they need rather than applying the permissions to the users. This saves time since you can set up groups like the sales team and set the permissions that the sales team need and then just add the users to this group and they receive those permissions.

There are lots of default groups that you might find on a windows environment. Some of the important ones include:
     * Administrators
     * Domain Administrators
     * Domain Guests
     * Domain Controllers
     * Enterprise Domain Controllers
     * Enterprise Read-only Domain Controllers
     * Remote Desktop Users
     * Server Operators

UKFast Threat Monitoring will monitor all of these and more, to see if any of these change (Have users or computers/servers added or removed from it)
