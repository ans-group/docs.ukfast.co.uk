=====================================
Databases
=====================================

The database is the backbone of many mission-critical systems. They store important credentials, product catalogues, sales records, statistics and PII. This makes database systems a prime target for attackers.

UKFast Threat Monitoring can help to track and monitor database services through advanced log monitoring. When coupled with regular vulnerability scanning and hardening, Threat Monitoring can help to secure your database services against even the most complex of attacks.

For more information on vulnerability scanning please visit our documentation here: https://docs.ukfast.co.uk/security/threatmonitoring/how-it-works.html#vulnerability-scans
