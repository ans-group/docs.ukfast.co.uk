Exploits
=====================================

New vulnerabilities and accompanying exploits are released every week and range in severity. Exploits that allow RCE (Remote Command Execution) or privilege escalation are especially dangerous to enterprise systems and servers. These exploits could allow a remote unauthenticated attacker to gain admin access into your systems.

UKFast Threat Monitoring can detect and block many known exploits to common services. Used in conjunction with regular vulnerability scanning, Threat Monitoring can be a powerful tool to secure your systems.
