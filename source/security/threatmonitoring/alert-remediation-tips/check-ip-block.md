# Checking if an IP has been blocked

Threat Monitoring can detect incoming attacks in real-time and proactively block them, minimising the risk of compromise. This is achieved through the use of iptables and hosts.deny on Linux, and Windows firewall on Windows systems

### Linux

If you need to check if an attacking Ip has been blocked, or of an IP address has been blocked unintentionally, you can use the below command on a Linux system to use check this with one of our scripts

`wget https://git.thmon.ukfast.co.uk/threatmon-public/threat-monitoring-scripts/raw/master/check-block-status.sh && bash check-block-status.sh {IP TO CHECK}`

If you'd like to automatically remove the IP from the block list, specify `--remove-found` when using the script, like below:

`wget https://git.thmon.ukfast.co.uk/threatmon-public/threat-monitoring-scripts/raw/master/check-block-status.sh && bash check-block-status.sh {IP TO CHECK} --remove-found`

### Windows

To check if an Ip has been blocked in windows, follow the below steps.

Open up the windows firewall configuration utility. This can be found by searching for "Windows Firewall with Advanced Security"

Click "Inbound rules" on the left pane

You should now be able to see all the incoming firewall rules.

Look for any rules with the name "WAZUH ACTIVE RESPONSE BLOCKED IP", check the 'Remote Address' column to see if the IP in question has been blocked.

If you'd like to remove an IP from the blocklist, you can right-click the rule that is enforcing the block, and click delete, confirming by pressing Yes.
