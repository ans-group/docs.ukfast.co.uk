WordPress is an incredibly powerful website CMS that powers over 40% of websites on the Internet, so its no surprise that it's also one of the most common targets for attackers. WordPress, being more user-orientated and it's the ability to be expanded with plugins is especially susceptible to exploits and Zero-Day attacks.
