# How to launch a phishing campaign

UKFast Phishing campaigns can be easily launched through MyUKFast's 'Phishing' section. In here you'll be able to create a new campaign, add users, distribution groups see phishing templates and manage ongoing/previous phishing campaigns.

# 1) Verifying a domain

When you first access the phishing as a service section of MyUKfast, you'll see a progress banner towards the top of your page. We'll use this to track our progress when launching our first campaign. 

To begin, let's press the blue 'click here' link to verify our first domain. This can also be accessed by clicking the 'Domains' link under the phishing section in the navigation bar to the left.

This will take us to the 'Domains' page, where we can add new domains to sending Phishing emails to. ***You can only send phishing emails to email domains that you have access to and with prior permission from the relevant parties.***

Once we have verified that we can send phishing emails, we can add a domain by pressing the blue 'Add Domain' button.

This will launch a section where you can add a domain and an initial email address that will be used to verify you have access to this domain. This email will not be added to any phishing campaigns just yet.

Add in your domain and email as shown below, clicking the green 'Add' button to add the domain once finished.

After adding a domain, we can see that it has been added to our account, but the 'Status' of the domain is 'Pending', as we still need to verify that we have access to this domain.

An email like the one shown below should have been sent to the email address you have just input. Clicking on the 'Verify your domain' link will mark this email domain as verified.

With our user's added, we can now create a distribution group for later reference in a phishing campaign. Disctivuton groups allow a selection of users to be used in a certain phishing campaign.

Looking at our progress bar at the top of the page, we can press the 'click here' link to go to the 'Groups' page. This can also be accessed by clicking the 'Groups' link under the phishing section in the navigation bar to the left.

Then, click on a user listed under 'Available Users' on the left to move it to 'Selected Users' on the right. 

The same process can be used to deselect users, clicking a user under 'Selected Users' on the right will select that user. moving it to the left under 'Available Users'

We can also use the 'Add All' and 'Remove All' buttons provided.

# 4) Launching a Phishing campaign

With our users added and groups created, we can now launch our first phishing campaign!

***Before you continue, please make sure you have added a whitelist/exemption rule in your email spam filter for emails coming from our email servers 178.238.132.248 and 185.207.111.242. This will prevent these emails from being blocked by your spam filter.***

Under the 'Campaigns' section, we can see a list of our previous campaigns. To start a new campaign, click the blue 'Create Campaign' button.
