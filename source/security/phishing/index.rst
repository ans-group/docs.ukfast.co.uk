Phishing as a Service
=====================================

Phishing as a service (PhaaS) from UKFast is our latest addition to our growing range of IT security products. With social engineering attacks and spear phishing attacks on the rise, it's never been more important to ensure your business is protected. UKFast's Phishing as a Service allows you to start a simulated phishing attack against your employees, testing their ability to detect and react to an incoming phishing attack.


PhaaS comes ready to go, with a selection of preconfigured phishing attack templates. Simply upload a list of emails to phishing, and launch a phishing test.
