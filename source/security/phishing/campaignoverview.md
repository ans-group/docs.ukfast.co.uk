# Campaign Overview

Once a campaign has been started, you can easily view it's overall status and track the actions of each user in the campaign. Looking at the example below, we can see that our test campaign has one user. We can that this suer has yet to open the email.

Once the user opens the email and downloads a tracking image, this will be shown in the dasboard.

Please note that mail clients like Microsofty Outlook have a security feature, that prevents external resouces, like images from being donwloaded automatcally. As a result, if a user opens an email via thease mail cliernts, it may not show up as opened on MyUKfast.

In addition, we can see if a user has cliocked the phsihihg link and submited data. We can also see an overview of all the user's status as a donut visulation.
