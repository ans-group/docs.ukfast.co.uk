This will take us to the 'Domains' page, here we can add new domains to sending Phishing emails to. ***You can only send phishing emails to email domains that you have access to and with prior permission from the relevent parties.***

Once we have verified that we can send phsing emails, we can add a domain by pressing the blue 'Add Domain' button.

This will launch a section where you can add a domain and an intitial email address that will be sued to verify you have access to this domain. This email will not be added to any phishing campaigns just yet.

Add in your domain and email as shown below, clicking the green 'Add' button to add the domain once finished.

After adding a domain, we can see that it has been added to our account, but the 'Status' of the domain is 'Pending', as we still need to verify that we have access to this domain.

An email like the one shown below should have been sent to the email address you have just input. Clicking on the 'Verify your domain' link will mark this email domain as verfied.
