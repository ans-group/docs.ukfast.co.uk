## Scanning Configuration

* The Virus Scanning Engine is configured to scan files when they are written to disk during real time scanning. We disable continous read scannning to prevent IO Saturation which would result in performance degradation.

* A Weekly scan is scheduled to scan all disks apart from any exclusions which have been specified, if you wish to add, remove or modify exclusions on your anti-virus scan, please contact support via a ticket, making sure that you include your requirements within the ticket, and we will be able to action those changes for you.

* Scanning of remote directories is disabled by default, however NFS mounts will be scanned and viewed as a local disk.

* Scanning Schedules can be customised to your requirements, or they can be managed by yourself, If you would like to have a custom schedule or if you would like to manage your own scanning schedule, please contact support via a ticket, making sure that you include your requirements within the ticket, and we will be able to action those changes for you.
