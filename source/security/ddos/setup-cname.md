# Setting up DDoSx<sup>®</sup>, CDN and WAF using an ALIAS, ANAME or CNAME

DDoSx<sup>®</sup>, can be setup to protect any domain from DDoS and common Web Application attacks such as SQL Injections, Remote Command Execution and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). More on how DDoSx<sup>®</sup> works can be found in our [DDoSx General Information](/security/ddos/generalinformation)

CDN and WAF are optional additional DDoSx<sup>®</sup> features, and as a result, DDoSx<sup>®</sup> must first be enabled on your domain(s) to allow CDN and WAF to be configured.

To use DDoSx<sup>®</sup>, CDN and WAF, you need to either have your domains' setup on UKFast SafeDNS and ensure its name servers pointing to the UKFast name servers or create an ANAME/ALIAS record with your current DNS provider to point to DDoSx<sup>®</sup> using a provided CNAME.

```eval_rst
.. warning::

   This documentation is for setting up DDoSx using an ALIAS, ANAME or CNAME. Documentation on setting up an domain via SafeDNS can be found in our :doc:`/security/ddos/safedns-setup` documentation.

```

To enable DDoSx<sup>®</sup>, CDN and WAF on your domains, follow these steps:

**[1. Prepare](#prepare-your-domain)** your domain(s) before adding to DDoSx<sup>®</sup>

**[2. Connect and verify](#connect-and-verify-your-domain)** your domain(s) to use DDoSx<sup>®</sup>

**[3. Configure Domain](#configure-domain)** your domain(s) with your preferred proxy settings

**[4. Configure Additional Features](#configure-additional-features)** for any CDN or WAF enabled domains

**[5. Test Domain and Put Live](#test-domain-and-put-live)** your domain(s) work properly before putting them live

```eval_rst
.. warning::
   DDoSx supports HTTP and HTTPS web traffic on ports 80 and 443 respectively. If you need to route other types of traffic to your UKFast-hosted solution then please contact us before setting up DDoSx\ :sup:`®`\ .
```

## 1) Prepare your domain

The first step to setting up DDoSx via an ALIAS, ANAME or CNAME is to prepare and check your domain before enabling DDoSx<sup>®</sup> protection. 

Before setting up a external domain in DDoSx<sup>®</sup>, double-check that your current DNS provider allow the creation of either an ALIAS, ANAME or flattened CNAME record if you wish to put your root domain (like ukfast.co.uk) behind DDoSx<sup>®</sup>.

Some DNS providers that allow these records include:

```eval_rst
==============   =================
DNS Provider     Record Type(s)
==============   =================
DNS Made Easy    ANAME
CloudFlare       Flattened CNAME
FastHosts        ALIAS
==============   =================
```

On the other hand, if you ONLY wish to place subdomains that are not used in MX records etc behind DDoSx<sup>®</sup>, then using a normal CNAME should work fine. 

## 2) Connect and verify your domain

- Login to [MyUKFast](https://my.ukfast.co.uk) and head to `DDoSx<sup>®</sup> Protection` in the navigation menu.

- Click the red `GET STARTED` button if this is your first domain, or click 'Add additional domain' in the top-right if this is an additional domain.

- Enter the domain that you want to protect in the 'Domain Name' text box

- As this is an external domain, a message in a blue box should appear informing you that this domain is not in SafeDNS and will need to be setup via DNS changed.

- Select any additional features you'd like to add to this domain such as CDN or WAF by clicking the checkbox next to your chosen features.

- Double-check your domain and selected additional features and then press 'Buy Now'

- Click `Complete Transaction` on the next page to complete the payment process. (You won't have to complete this step if you have already ordered DDoSx<sup>®</sup>, WAF or CDN via your UKFast account manager -  Any existing credits will be consumed first).

![connect](files/ddosx_cname_connect.png)

Once the transaction has completed, you will be asked to verify that you own this domain. You can do this one of two ways, either add a TXT record in your current DNS provider with the provided value, or upload a file to your server that can be accessed via your domain.

- Select the verification type you want to use

![verify](files/ddosx_cname_verify.png)

**Verify via DNS**

- Select the DNS verification method
- Create a TXT record with your current DNS provider for the root of your domain, setting the value of the TXT record to the value provided on the verify domain page. An `@` symbol or blank value is commonly used when specifying the root domain. For example:

```eval_rst
===========   ========   ========================================================================================
Record Type   Hostname   Value
===========   ========   ========================================================================================
TXT           @          ddosx-site-verification=245b62a2878fc30hd6altya37f00fe29e09c0f1f7d9d43a72f07fns06af8e2be
===========   ========   ========================================================================================
```

- Once the TXT record has been created, allow some time for the DNS changes to propagate, this normally take no longer than 5 minutes but can take up to 48 hours.
- Use the `Verify` button on the Domain verification page to check if the record has been applied successfully. If DDoSx<sup>®</sup> finds the correct TXT record, your domain will be verified. Be sure to leave this record applied to your DNS as DDoSx<sup>®</sup> may periodically check that you still have control over domain.

**Veriify via File Upload**

- Select the `File Upload` verification method
- Press the `Download File` button to download the verification file to your local machine
- Using FTP or a web GUI for example, upload the downloaded verification file to the root of your website. This is commonly inside a `www` or `public_html` folder. 
- Once uploaded, the file should be accessible by navigating to your domain followed by the name of the file. For example https://non-safedns-domain.co.uk/e9e0a272db6b707e81a88ac4baed776367d15dbd.txt
- Once the file has been uploaded and working, press the `Verify` button on the domain verification page. If DDoSx<sup>®</sup> finds the correct verification file, your domain will be verified. Be sure to leave this file on your server as DDoSx<sup>®</sup> may periodically check that you still have control over domain.

## 3) Configure Domain

Once a new domain has been added to DDoSx<sup>®</sup>, you will automatically be taken to the configuration page for that domain. 

**Setting up Records**

Alternatively, navigate to the main DDoSx<sup>®</sup> page on via the navigation bar on the left, click on the domain you want to configure, and then and click `Configure` tab.

First, use the `Add Record` button to configure your root and subdomains' origin IP address. This will be the IP address that the request is forwarded to after being routed through DoSX<sup>®</sup>. This is usually your web server or load balancer's external IP address. 

![configuredomain](files/ddosx_add_record.png)

You can add multiple subdomains at once via the `Add Record` button. Once you're happy with your configure, press the `Confirm` button

The origin IP address of any of your subdomains (Including your root domain) can be changed by editing the IP in the text box shown under `Origin IP` for the specific record.

**Adding SSL Certificates**

Before pressing the `Apply Changes` button, we can add any required SSL certificates to our domains. 

To add an SSL certificate, click the `SSL` Tab. Any existing SSL certificates or SSL certificates purchased through UKFast for this domain should show up here.

If the required SSL certificate for the domain does not show up in here, we can add it by pressing the `Add SSL` button.

Enter your SSL's Private Key, Certificate, any CA/Chain certificates (Optional) and a name for this SSL. Press the `Create an SSL` button to add your SSL to DoSX<sup>®</sup>.

![addssl](files/ddosx_add_ssl.png)

At this point, you should be able to go back into the `DNS Records` tab and select the SSL you want to apply via the `SSL` dropdown for each record. Only SSLs that are valid for the configured subdomain will show in the dropdown. For example, an SSL for only `www.ukfast.co.uk` and `ukfast.co.uk` will NOT show in the dropdown for `my.ukfast.co.uk`. Wildcard SSL certificates should show for all applicable subdomains.


Finally, click `Apply Changes` and your domain will now be set up on the UKFast DDoSx<sup>®</sup> network, and configured appropriately. (You should allow up to 10 minutes for the changes to be fully applied)

```eval_rst
.. warning::
   Your domain has not been put live yet, this step only configures the domain within DDoSx. Please continue with the rest of this documentation to test and put your domain live.
```

## 4) Configure Additional Features

You now have the option to configure and additional DDoSx<sup>®</sup> features such as CDN and WAF before testing and putting your domain live. 

The configuration of CDN and WAF can be quite complex, so each has its own documentation.

[CDN Documentation](/network/cdn/cachingrules)

[WAF Documentation](/security/ddos/wafsettings)

Alternatively, you can skip the configuration of additional features for now and re-visit it after DDoSx<sup>®</sup> has been verified as working and put live. To do this, continue to step 5.

## 5) Test domain and put live

**Test Domain**

Once you've connected your domain to the DDoSx<sup>®</sup> network and configured your DNS records, you may wish to test that your website or application will work correctly before changing your live DNS.  This can be done by modifying your local `hosts` file to look for the DDoSx<sup>®</sup> "DNS CNAME Record" address for your domain, which can found at the top of the `DNS Records` page in DDoSx<sup>®</sup> for each domain.

![serverpreview](files/ddosx_cname_record.png)

Locate the `hosts` file on your computer.  On Windows, you'll find it in **C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc**.  

Open the `hosts` file using Notepad or another plain text editor (you may need administrator rights to make changes), and insert a line for each domain you wish to test, that includes the domain and the CNAME Value from DDoSx<sup>®</sup>; for example:

```
64cf9871a5b0ca045an96udtf9a63687c180f47df6.user.ddosx.com mydomain.co.uk
64cf9871a5b0ca045an96udtf9a63687c180f47df6.user.ddosx.com  www.mydomain.co.uk
64cf9871a5b0ca045an96udtf9a63687c180f47df6.user.ddosx.com blog.mydomain.co.uk
```
On Linux and macOS you can open and edit the `hosts` file in a terminal window using a command such as

```
 sudo nano /private/etc/hosts
```

[This article](https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/27350/beginner-geek-how-to-edit-your-hosts-file/) contains more detailed instructions on modifying the `hosts` file on macOS, Linux, and different versions of Windows.

Once you've added all the domains you need to test to your `hosts` file, save the changes. Then open a web browser and try browsing to your domain.  Your local `hosts` file will route the request directly to the DDoSx<sup>®</sup> CNAME address so you'll be able to see exactly how your site will perform when you change your DNS records.

**Put domain Live**

If you're happy with how your site performs, you can make the required DNS changes with your current DNS provider to point traffic to DDoSx<sup>®</sup>.

The process to change DNS record varies between providers, so we do recommended following your DNS providers documentation should you need assistance creating ALIAS, ANAME or CNAME records.

To create these records, you will need to log into to your current DNS provider and delete and existing A, AAAA, ALIAS ANAME or CNAME records for the domain or sub domain you want to route through DDoSx<sup>®</sup>. Feel free to take a backup of your DNS configuration of your prover supports it. A screenshot may also be useful. 

Next, if you're setting up your root domain, create either an ALIAS or ANAME record and set the hostname to your root domain. This is commonly done by setting the `hostname` to an `@` symbol or a blank value. Then set the value/target of this record to your unique DDoSx<sup>®</sup> DNS CNAME Record value. For example:

```eval_rst
===========   ========   =========================================================
Record Type   Hostname   Target
===========   ========   =========================================================
ALIAS         @          64cf9871a5b0ca045an96udtf9a63687c180f47df6.user.ddosx.com
===========   ========   =========================================================
```

If you're setting up a non-root domain like `portal.example.com` that is not used in MX records etc, you can instead create a simple CNAME record, following the same process as above, but setting the record type to CNAME. An ALAIS or ANAME would also work too. For example:

```eval_rst
===========   ========   =========================================================
Record Type   Hostname   Target
===========   ========   =========================================================
CNAME         portal     64cf9871a5b0ca045an96udtf9a63687c180f47df6.user.ddosx.com
===========   ========   =========================================================
```

Once your DNS changes have been applied and DNS propagation has concluded, your domain will be fully set up with DDoSx<sup>®</sup> protection.

## Further Configuration

You may wish to add further configuration on your origin server to work more closely with DDoSx<sup>®</sup>. Some common configurations are documented below.

### Block Traffic not from DDoSx<sup>®</sup> (optional but recommended)

```eval_rst
.. warning::
   Make sure all websites hosted on your origin server are behind DDoSx before applying these firewall rules. As doing so cut off access to any websites not protected by DDoSx<.
```

Now that DDoSx<sup>®</sup> is configured for your domain, and requests going to your domain and via common name servers will be routed through DDoSx<sup>®</sup>, however, attackers commonly try to avoid proxies like DDoSx<sup>®</sup> by using custom DNS servers to make the domain resolve to your origin server's IP instead of DDoSx<sup>®</sup>, bypassing the protection it offers. Furthermore, an attacker may still be able to attack your origin server by sending requests to the IP directly, (http://185.234.39.17/ for example).

To prevent both these evasion methods, you can add firewall rules to only allow traffic on port TCP 443 and TCP 80 from our DDoSx<sup>®</sup> IP ranges mentioned below.

```
185.156.64.0/24
23.170.128.0/24
192.166.44.0/24
78.24.88.0/24
195.69.102.0/24
185.181.196.0/22
```

These rules would commonly take the form of an allow rule for port TCP 80 and TCP 443 for each of the above IP ranges, followed by a deny rule for all other IPs using TCP 80 and TCP 443.

Example rules for IPTables are below:

```
iptables --append INPUT --protocol tcp --src 185.156.64.0/24 --dport 80 --jump ACCEPT
iptables --append INPUT --protocol tcp --src 23.170.128.0/24 --dport 80 --jump ACCEPT
iptables --append INPUT --protocol tcp --src 192.166.44.0/24 --dport 80 --jump ACCEPT
iptables --append INPUT --protocol tcp --src 78.24.88.0/24 --dport 80 --jump ACCEPT
iptables --append INPUT --protocol tcp --src 195.69.102.0/24 --dport 80 --jump ACCEPT
iptables --append INPUT --protocol tcp --src 185.181.196.0/22 --dport 80 --jump ACCEPT
iptables --append INPUT --protocol tcp --src 185.156.64.0/24 --dport 443 --jump ACCEPT
iptables --append INPUT --protocol tcp --src 23.170.128.0/24 --dport 443 --jump ACCEPT
iptables --append INPUT --protocol tcp --src 192.166.44.0/24 --dport 443 --jump ACCEPT
iptables --append INPUT --protocol tcp --src 78.24.88.0/24 --dport 443 --jump ACCEPT
iptables --append INPUT --protocol tcp --src 195.69.102.0/24 --dport 443 --jump ACCEPT
iptables --append INPUT --protocol tcp --src 185.181.196.0/22 --dport 443 --jump ACCEPT
iptables --append INPUT --protocol tcp --dport 80 --jump DROP
iptables --append INPUT --protocol tcp --dport 443 --jump DROP
```

### Configure webserver logging (optional but recommended)

Once your domain is fully enabled on DDoSx<sup>®</sup>, all requests to your webserver will appear to come from the DDoSx<sup>®</sup> IP address rather than the original client. Therefore you may wish to configure your webserver to place the original client IP address into the logs. This is most important if you're using a stats package like Webalizer or AWStats, which rely on analysing your local web server logs.

Here's how to do this for NGiNX and Apache:

**NGiNX**

For NGiNX, insert this code into one of the `http` or `server` blocks in your configuration. This requires the [realip](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_realip_module.html) module be compiled into nginx. You can confirm if this is already there with `nginx -V 2>&1 | grep -o realip`. If this outputs `realip`, you're good to go.

```
set_real_ip_from 185.156.64.0/24;
set_real_ip_from 23.170.128.0/24;
set_real_ip_from 192.166.44.0/24;
set_real_ip_from 78.24.88.0/24;
set_real_ip_from 195.69.102.0/24;
set_real_ip_from 2a02:21a8:1::/48;
set_real_ip_from 2a02:21a8:2::/48;
set_real_ip_from 2a02:21a8::/48;
set_real_ip_from 2a09:ba00:4::/48;
set_real_ip_from 2a09:b600:5::/48;
set_real_ip_from 2a09:b200:6::/48;
real_ip_header X-Forwarded-For;
real_ip_recursive on;
```

Once you have added these into your configuration, test and reload your NGiNX configuration (e.g. `nginx -t && systemctl reload nginx`) to make the changes live.

**Apache**

For Apache 2.4 and above, you will need to use the [mod_remoteip](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_remoteip.html) module. This should be compiled into your Apache installation, but you can confirm this by running `httpd -M 2>&1 | grep remoteip` (use `apache2ctl` instead of `httpd` on Debian/Ubuntu), which should output `remoteip_module (shared)`. As long as you have that, you're good to go. Add the following into your `<VirtualHost>` declaration, and then alter any `CustomLog` directives to use the newly defined `LogFormat`.

```
<IfModule remoteip_module>
    RemoteIPHeader X-Forwarded-For
    RemoteIPTrustedProxy 185.156.64.0/24
    RemoteIPTrustedProxy 23.170.128.0/24
    RemoteIPTrustedProxy 192.166.44.0/24
    RemoteIPTrustedProxy 78.24.88.0/24
    RemoteIPTrustedProxy 195.69.102.0/24
    RemoteIPTrustedProxy 2a02:21a8:1::/48
    RemoteIPTrustedProxy 2a02:21a8:2::/48
    RemoteIPTrustedProxy 2a02:21a8::/48
    RemoteIPTrustedProxy 2a09:ba00:4::/48
    RemoteIPTrustedProxy 2a09:b600:5::/48
   RemoteIPTrustedProxy 2a09:b200:6::/48
</IfModule>
LogFormat "%a %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" ddosx

# You may already have a line like the following in your VirtualHost declaration,
# if so, change the last part (likely the word `combined`) to `ddosx` to use the
# above log format.
CustomLog /var/log/httpd/acmecorp.com/access.log ddosx
```

Test and then reload your Apache configuration (e.g. `httpd -t && systemctl reload httpd`) to make the changes live.

For Apache 2.2 you will need to use [mod_rpaf](https://github.com/gnif/mod_rpaf), the use of which is beyond the scope of this document.

**haproxy**

If you have haproxy in front of your webservers, you'll probably want to set the
X-Forwarded-For header on here. The easiest way to do this is to disable the 
`forwardfor` option to prevent haproxy setting the header automatically and instead
set the header manually in each backend.

First, comment out your forwardfor option, potentially in the `defaults` section, e.g.

```
defaults
    #option forwardfor except 192.168.1.10
...
```

Then, in each backend set the `X-Forwarded-For` header to match the value of the `DDOSX-Connecting-IP` header:

```
backend webservers
    mode http
    http-request set-header X-Forwarded-For %[req.hdr(DDOSX-Connecting-IP)]
    server web1 ...
```
