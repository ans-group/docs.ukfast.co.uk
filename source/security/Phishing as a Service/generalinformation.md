# General Information

Phishing as a service is a tool that allows you to simulate phishing attacks on employees within your organisation. As the initial attack vector that leads to 90% of data breaches, it is important to test user awareness and their understanding of the most common threats faced day to day. Statistics show that 97% of people cannot detect a sophisticated phishing email. By utilising Phishing as a service, you can safely expose your user base to the most prevalent attacks seen, without any worry of compromise and data loss.

## What is Phishing as a service?
Using MyUKFast, create a phishing campaign by uploading a list of your users email addresses, putting them into groups and choosing from a list of specially created email templates and landing pages based on the most common emails seen.
