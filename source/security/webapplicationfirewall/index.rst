========================
Web Application Firewall
========================

A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is an important component of your IT infrastructure's overall security solution.  UKFast offers two different WAF solutions

- a hardware-based WAF, integrated into your UKFast-hosted solution
- a network-based WAF, run on our global DDoSX\ :sup:`Â®` network

Both offer the level of application protection you will need, with various configuration options available.  These pages describe broadly what a WAF is and how it functions; it's also worth reading the :doc:`/security/ddos/index` section to understand how our network-based WAF works as part of DDoSX.
