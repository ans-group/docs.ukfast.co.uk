# EXIM mail transfer agent


Exim is an open source mail transfer agent. It is most commonly found on Web Host Monitor (WHM) /cPanel servers. You can configure Exim through the command line or through the cPanel itself. The guide below focuses on ways to configure Exim and the various ways you can parse logs.

## Where are the logs?

Exim logs are generally found in `/var/log/exim_mainlog` on cPanel servers. This can be modified by making changes to the Exim configuration file found in `/etc/exim.conf`. The variable that can be changed is shown below.

```console
  log_file_path = /var/log/$primary_hostname/exim_%slog
```

## Changing logging parameters.

To get more information out of the logs, you can change the parameters to add or remove information that is logged by Exim for mails that are delivered and received by your server. The variable is called the log_selector. You can modify it in the `/etc/exim.conf` file.

```console
  log_selector = +arguments -retry_defer
```

Here are some of the optional log items.

```console
        acl_warn_skipped             skipped warn statement in ACL

```

## Parsing logs.

Here are some basic commands that you can use to look through the mail queue. These are especially useful if your mail queue has a large amount of emails. A mail queue with a lot of emails could point to a misconfiguration or a compromise on the server with malicious code causing the server to generate spam out. Here are a few of the basic commands that you can use through SSH to look at the details of your mail queue.

View the mail queue.

```console
  exim -bpc
```

View the mail queue with email IDs.

```console
  exim -bp
```

Force delivery for a single mail in the mail queue.

```console
  exim -M [ID]
```

Start sending mail out from the queue to clear it.

```console
  exim -qf
```

Force a queue out with frozen emails.

```console
  exim -qff
```

Check the emails individually. The `l` stands for log, the `b` stands for body, the `h` stands for header.

```console
  exim -Mvb [ID]
  exim -Mvl [ID]
  exim -Mvh [ID]
```

## Digging deeper into the logs.

Some of the commands below can allow you to find the source of spam or identify a single user sending a lot of mail out. This is particularly useful during compromise investigations.

The following helps to spot spammers sending mail from their `/home/` directory.

```console
  zegrep 'cwd=/home' `ls -tr /var/log/exim_mainlog*` | awk '{print $3}' | cut -d '/' -f3 | sort -bg | uniq -c | sort -bgr | head -n20
```

The command below is used to identify the directory it's coming from for that account.

```console
  grep cwd /var/log/exim_mainlog | grep -v /var/spool | awk -F"cwd=" '{print $2}' | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
```

The following also helps to find if a particular user is sending a lot of mail.

```console
  zegrep -oh 'A=dovecot[^ ]+' `ls -tr /var/log/exim_mainlog*` | sort | uniq -c | sort –n
```

## Clearing the Eximstats database.

You can use the following command from the MySQL CLI to clear the eximstats database in case the size is getting too large.

This is a one liner that will remove parts of the eximstats database.

```SQL
  use eximstats;delete from sends;delete from smtp;delete from failures;delete from defers;
```


## How to clear the Exim mail queue.

Here is a one liner that will allow you to clear the entire mail queue. This is especially useful if you have a large number of spam mails in the mail queue.

```console
  exim -bp | exiqgrep -i | xargs exim -Mrm
```

You can also delete mail from a specific sender using the command below. This is useful if you have a single user generating spam.

```console
  exiqgrep -ir email@domain.com | xargs exim -Mrm
```

## Permissions/ownership issues on WHM/cPanel servers

Occasionally, Exim running under WHM/cPanel will encounter problems with file permissions that present a wide array of unusual problems. This is a common enough issue that WHM provide an excellent repair script via the WHM web panel. When encountering any email problem on an WHM server, this script is a great place to start investigating: Home > Email > Repair Mailbox Permissions

## Official Exim Documentation.

If your needs require specific tweaks or configuration additions, we suggest that you use the [official Exim documentation](http://www.exim.org/exim-html-current/doc/html/spec_html/index.html) maintained by the University of Cambridge.
